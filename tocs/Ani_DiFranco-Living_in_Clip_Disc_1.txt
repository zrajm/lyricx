3. Gravel

I heard the sound of your bike,
As your wheels hit the gravel,
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting off
And I pushed through the screen door
And I stood out on the porch
Thinking fight, fight, fight
At all costs,
But instead I let you in,
Just like I've always done
And I sat you down and offered you a beer
And across the kitchen table
I fired several rounds,
But you were still sitting there
When the smoke cleared.
And you came crawling back
To say that you wanna
Make good in the end

[ so let's go before I change my mind ]
[ I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind ]
[ 'cuz I am better than everything that came before... ]
[ and you were never very kind... ]

And oh, oh,
Let me count the ways
That I abhor you,
And you were never a good lay
And you were never a good friend
But, oh, oh, what else can I say...
I adore you

All I need is my leather,
One t-shirt and two socks,
I'll keep my hands warm
In your pockets
And you can use the engine block,
And we'll ride out to california
With my arms around your chest,
And I'll pretend that this is real
'Cuz this is what I like best,
And you've been juggling two women
Like a stupid circus clown
Telling us both we are the one
And maybe you can keep me from ever being happy,
But you're not gonna stop me from having fun.
So let's go before I change my mind
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind
'Cuz I am bigger than everything that came before

And you were never very kind,
And you let me way down every time
But oh, oh, oh what can I say...
I adore you

I heard the sound of your bike,
As your wheels hit the gravel,
Then your engine in the driveway
Cutting off


4. Willing to Fight

The windows of my soul
Are made of one way glass
Don't bother looking into my eyes
If there's something you want to know,
Just ask
I got a dead bolt stroll
Where I'm going is clear
I won't wait for you to wonder
I'll just tell you why I'm here

'Cause I know the biggest crime
Is just to throw up your hands
Say
This has nothing to do with me
I just want to live as comfortably as I can
You got to look outside your eyes
You got to think outside your brain
You got to walk outside you life
To where the neighborhood changes

Tell me who is your boogieman
That's who I will be
You don't have to like me for who I am
But we'll see what you're made of
By what you make of me
I think that it's absurd
That you think I
Am the derelict daughter
I fight fire with words
Words are hotter than flames
Words are wetter than water

I got friends all over this country
I got friends in other countries too
I got friends I haven't met yet
I got friends I never knew
I got lovers whose eyes
I've only seen at a glance
I got strangers for great grandchildren
I got strangers for ancestors

I was a long time coming
I'll be a long time gone
You've got your whole life to do something
And that's not very long
So why don't you give me a call
When you're willing to fight
For what you think is real
For what you think is right


5. Shy

The heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns the road to water
And then from water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
And it starts at the sink
There's a bathroom in a gas station
And I've locked myself in it to think

And back in the city
The sun bakes the trash on the curb
The men are pissing in doorways
And the rats run in herds
I've got a dream of your face
That scares me awake
I put too much on my table
And now I got too much a stake

And I might let you off easy
Yeah I might lead you on
I might wait for you to look for me
And then I might be gone
Where I come from and where I'm going
And I'm lost in between
I might go up to that phone booth
And leave a veiled invitation on you machine

And you'll stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
The one where I surprise you
By showing up at your front door
Saying 'let's not ask what's next,
Or how, or why'
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy

The door opens, the room winces
The housekeeper comes in without a warning
I squint at the muscular motel light
And say, hey good morning
As she jumps, her keys jingle
And she leaves as quickly as she came in
I roll over and taste the pillow with my grin
The sheets are twisted and damp
And the heat is so great
And I swear I can feel the mattress
Sinking underneath your weight
Oh sleep is like a fever
And I'm glad when it ends
And the road flows like a river
And pulls me around every bend


And you'll stop me, won't you...

The heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns road to water
And water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
And it starts at the sink
There's a bathroom in a gas station
And I've locked myself
In it to think

And you'll stop me, won't you...


6. Joyful Girl

I do it for the joy it brings
Because I'm a joyful girl
Because the world owes me nothing
And we owe each other the world
I do it because it's the least I can do
I do it because I learned it from you
And I do it just because I want to
Because I want to

Everything I do is judged
And they mostly get it wrong
But oh well
'Cuz the bathroom mirror has not budged
And the woman who lives there can tell
The truth from the stuff that they say
And she looks me in the eye
And says would you prefer the easy way
No, well o.k. then
Don't cry

I wonder if everything I do
I do instead
Of something I want to do more
The question fills my head
I know there's no grand plan here
This is just the way it goes
When everything else seems unclear
I guess at least I know

I do it for the joy it brings
Because I'm a joyful girl
Because the world owes me nothing
And we owe each other the world
I do it because it's the least I can do
I do it because I learned it from you
And I do it just because I want to
Because I want to


7. Hide and Seek

Me and all the kids from the neighbourhood
We play out in the street all summer long
Rule was we had to go home at nite when the street lights came on

We were oblivious to the rest of the world
We hold up the cars in the street
We always played boys against girls
And both sides would cheat

Strange men would stop their cars at the curb
Say "hey sweetheart, come here"
And I would go up to the window
And they would have their dick out in there hands
And a sick little sneer

I'd say "here we go again
Yeah, this time you win"
I would feel dirty; I would feel ashamed
But I wouldn't let it stop my game

We would play hide and go seek
Territory would be the whole block
Sometimes the older boys when they find you
They wouldn't want to tag you
They just want to talk
They say "what would you do for a quarter?
Come on, we don't have that much time"
I'd think for a minute and I'd say
"ok, give me the quarter first. fine"

This time you win
Here we go again
And I would feel dirty and I would feel ashamed
But I wouldn't let it stop my game

I remember my first trip alone on the greyhound bus
A man who put his hands on me as soon as nite fell
I remember when I was leaving how excited I was
I remember when I arrived I didn't feel so well
I remember the teachers who got me so sick
Scared, I went into the bathroom and I threw up in my hair
I could go on but you know what it just gets worse
So I should probably stop there.

Girl, next time he wants to know what your problem is
Girl, next time he wants to know where the anger comes from
Just tell him this time the problem is his
Just tell him the anger just comes
It just comes


8. Napoleon

They told you your music could reach millions
The choice was up to you
You told me they always pay for lunch
And they believe in what I do
And I wonder if you'll miss your old friends
Once you've proven what you're worth
And I wonder when you're a big star
Will you miss the earth
And I know you always, always want more
I know you, you'll never be done

Because everyone is a fucking napoleon
Everyone is a fucking napoleon

And the next time that I saw you
You were larger than life
Yeah you came and you conquered
You were doing all right
You had an army of suits behind you
And all you had to be was willing
And I said I still make a pretty good living
You must make a killing, a killing
And I hope that, that you are happy
I hope that at least you are having fun

Oh but everyone is a fucking napoleon
Well everyone is a fucking napoleon

You say that, so that's the way it's gonna be
So that's what this is all about
I think that that's the way it always was
You chose not to notice until now
Oh now that, now that there's a problem
You call me up to confide
And you go on for over an hour
About each one that took you for a ride
And I guess that you dialed my number
Because you thought for sure that I'd agree
I said baby, you know I still love you
But how dare you complain to me

Oh but everyone is a fucking napoleon
Everyone is a fucking napoleon
Everyone is a fucking napoleon


9. I'm No Heroine

You think I wouldn't have him
Unless I could have him by the balls
You think I just dish it out
You don't think I take it at all
You think I am stronger
You think I walk taller than the rest
You think I'm usually wearing the pants
Just 'cause I rarely wear a dress

Well...

When you look at me
You see my purpose,
See my pride
You think I just saddle up my anger
And ride and ride and ride
You think I stand so firm
You think I sit so high on my trusty steed
Let me tell you
I'm usually face down on the ground
When there's a stampede

I'm no heroine
At least, not last time I checked
I'm too easy to roll over
I'm too easy to wreck
I just write about
What I should have done
I just sing
What I wish I could say
And hope somewhere
Some woman hears my music
And it helps her through her day

'Cause some guy designed
These shoes I use to walk around
Some big man's business turns a profit
Every time I lay my money down
Some guy designed the room I'm standing in
Another built it with his own tools
Who says I like right angles?
These are not my laws
There are not my rules

I'm no heroine
I still answer to the other half of the race
I don't fool myself
Like I fool you
I don't have the power
We just don't run this place


10. Amazing Grace

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That save a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught
My heart to fear
And grace that fear relieved
How precious did
That grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
I have already come
'Twas grace that brought me
Safely thus far
And grace will lead me home

And when this heart
And flesh shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess
Within the vale
A life of joy and peace


11. Anticipate

You are subtle as a window pane
Standing in my view
But I will wait for it to rain
So that I can see you
You call me up at night
When there's no light passing through
And you think that I don't understand
But I do

We don't say everything that we could
So that we can say later
Oh, you misunderstood
I hold my cards up
Close to my chest
I say what I have to
And I hold back the rest

'Cause someone you don't know
Is someone you don't know
Get a firm grip, girl
Before you let go
For every hand extended
Another lies in wait
Keep your eye on that one
Anticipate

Dress down get out there
Pick a fight with the police
We will get it all on film
For the new release
Seems like everyone's an actor
Or they're an actor's best friend
I wonder what was wrong to begin with
That they should all have to pretend
We lost sight of everything
When we have to keep checking our backs
I think we should all just smile
Come clean
And relax

If there's anything I've learned
All these years on my own
It's how to find my own way there
And how to find my own way back home


12. Tiptoe

Tiptoeing through the used condoms
Strewn on the piers
Off the west side highway
Sunset behind
The skyline of jersey
Walking towards the water
With a fetus holding court in my gut
My body highjacked
My tits swollen and sore
The river has more colors at sunset
Than my sock drawer ever dreamed of
I could wake up screaming sometimes
But I don't
I could step off the end of this pier but
I've got shit to do
And I've an appointment on tuesday
To shed uninvited blood and tissue
I'll miss you I say
To the river to the water
To the son or daughter
I thought better of
I could fall in love
With jersey at sunset
But I leave the view to the rats
And tiptoe back


13. Sorry I Am

I'm sorry I didn't sound more excited on the phone
I'm sorry that after all these years
I've left you feeling unrequited and alone, brought you to tears
I guess I never loved you quite as well as the way you loved me
I guess I'll never really be able to tell you how sorry
I am

And I don't know what it is about you
I just know it's not what it was
I don't know why red fades before blue it just does
And I don't know what it is about me
That I just can't keep still
I keep thinking someday I will make this all up to you
And maybe someday I will

I guess I never loved you quite as well
As the way you loved me
I guess I'll never really be able to tell you how sorry
I am
Sorry I am
Sorry I am
Sorry I am


14. The Slant / The Diner

The slant
A building settling around me
My figure female framed crookedly
In the threshold
Of the room
Door scraping floorboards
With every opening
Carving a rough history
Of bedroom scenes
The plot hard to follow
The text obscured
In the folds of sheets
Slowly gathering the stains
Of seasons spent lying there
Red and brown
Like leaves fallen
The colors of an eternal cycle
Fading with the
Wash cycle
And the rinse cycle
Again an unfamiliar smell
Like my name misspelled
Or misspoken
A cycle broken
The sound of them strong
Stalking talking about their prey
Like the way hammer meets nail
Pounding, they say
Pounding out the rhythms of attraction
Like a woman was a drum like a body was a weapon
Like there was something more they wanted
Than the journey
Like it was owed to them
Steel toed they walk
And I'm wondering why this fear of men
Maybe it's because I'm hungry
And like a baby I'm dependent on them
To feed me
I am a work in progress
Dressed in the fabric of a world unfolding
Offering me intricate patterns of questions
Rhythms that never come clean
And strengths that you still haven't seen

I'm calling from the diner
The diner on the corner
I ordered two coffees
One is for you
I was hoping you'd join me
'Cause I ain't go no money
And I really miss you
I should mention that too

Yes I know what time it is
In fact, I just checked
I even know the date
And the month
And the year
I know I haven't been sleeping
And when I do
I just dream of you
Dear

I miss watching you
Drool on your pillow
I miss watching you
Pull on your clothes
I miss listening
To you in the bathroom
Flushing the toilet
Blowing your nose

I'm calling from the diner
The diner on the corner
I ordered two coffees
One is for you
The cups are so close
The steam is rising
In one stream
How are you

I think you're the least fucked up
Person I've ever met
And that may be as close to the real thing
As I'm ever gonna get
But my quarter's gonna run out now
Or so I'm told
I guess I'd better go sit down
And wait for you
Till my coffee gets cold


15. 32 Flavors

Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am thirty-two flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
Cause someday you're going to get hungry
And eat most of the words you just said

Both my parents taught me about good will
And I have done well by their names
Just the kindness I've lavished on strangers
Is more than I can explain
Still there's many who've turned out their porch lights
Just so I would think they were not home
And hid in the dark of their windows
Till I'd passed and left them alone

And god help you if you are an ugly girl
Course too pretty is also your doom
Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
For the prettiest girl in the room
And god help you if you are a phoenix
And you dare to rise up from the ash
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy
While you are just flying past

I'm not trying to give my life meaning
By demeaning you
And I would like to state for the record
I did everything that I could do
I'm not saying that I'm a saint
I just don't want to live that way
No, I will never be a saint
But I will always say

Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am thirty-two flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
Cause someday you might find you're starving
And eating all of the words you said


16. Out of Range

Just the thought
Of our bed
Makes me crumble like the plaster
Where you punched the wall beside my head
And I try
To draw the line
But it ends up running down the middle of me
Most of the time

Boys get locked up in some prison
Girls get locked up in some house
And it don't matter if it's a warden
Or a lover
Or a spouse
You just can't talk to 'em
You just can't reason
You just can't leave
And you just can't please 'em

I was locked
Into being my mother's daughter
I was just eating bread and water
Thinking
Nothing ever changes
And I was shocked
To see the mistakes of each generation
Will just fade like a radio station
If you drive out of range

If you're not angry
You're just stupid
Or you don't care
How else can you react
When you know
Something's so unfair
The men of the hour
Can kill half the world in war
Make them slaves to a super power
And let them die poor

I was locked
Into being my mother's daughter
I was just eating bread and water
Thinking
Nothing ever changes
And I was shocked
To see the mistakes of each generation
Will just fade like a radio station
If you drive out of range

Just the thought
Of our bed
Makes me crumble like the plaster
Where you punched the wall beside my head
And I try
To draw the line
But it ends up running down the middle of me
Most of the time

Baby I love you
That's why I'm leaving
There's no talking to you
And there's no pleasing you
And I care enough
That I'm mad
That half the world don't even know
What they could have had

I was locked
Into being my mother's daughter
I was just eating bread and water
Thinking
Nothing ever changes
And I was shocked
To see the mistakes of each generation
Will just fade like a radio station
If you drive out of range
