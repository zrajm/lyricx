The Mamas and the Papas: Dream a Little Dream of Me

Star shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper,
"I love you."
Birds singing in the sycamore tree,
"Dream a little dream of me."

Say "nightie-night" and kiss me,
just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger fill dawn, dear
Just saying this:

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams what ever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Star shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper,
"I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree,
"Dream a little dream and kiss me,
just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this:

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams what ever they be
Dream a little dream of me
