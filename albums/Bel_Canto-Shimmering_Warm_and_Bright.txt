1. Unicorn

There is a chapel in the woods
Where from the farthest-seeing senses rule
There is a scroll inside a casket
Clear blue eyes have worn this outfit

Yes I knew it was no moonshine, it is real
I feel much better
Better, better
Now I know this spiral shaft
Can possess the brightness of the light

Oh, I sayeth
Thou art mine true companion
And I wish
Thou wilt enter my kingdom
Oh, mesmerising unicorn

When in danger it will glow
A glimmer can foresee all threats to come
Gone are disbeliefs and doubts
It would be nice, so nice, so nice

Oh, I sayeth
Thou art mine true companion
And I wish
Thou wilt enter my kingdom
Oh, I sayeth
Thou art mine true companion
And I hope
Thou wilt enter my kingdom
Oh yes, I wish
I really wish


2. Summer


The place they were stranded
The traces that they made
All got washed away
The people before us
The fires that they burned
Somehow all want out

Let's make a decision
Alone I cannot judge
The tide is coming in
Yes I know
It's all for the better
Come with me if you want
'Cause I am heading home

But I feel no guilt
I'm doing all the things that I want to do
Do we all believe in contemplation
Do we all believe it?
I put my boat right on the water
I hear the voices calling, but is it you?
Do we all believe in endless summers?
Do we all believe in summer?
Do we all believe in summer?

So do you remember
Or is it what you're told
Who am I to know?
It's all for the better
Come with me if you want
'Cause I am heading home

But I feel no guilt
I'm doing all the things that I want to do
Do we all believe in contemplation
Do we all believe it?
I put my boat right on the water
I hear the voices calling, but is it you?
Do we all believe in endless summers?
Do we all believe in summer?
I put my boat right on the water, yeah
I put my boat right on the water, yeah


3. Die Geschichte einer Mutter (A mother's tale)

Sie hatte ein kindlein
So schwach, wie ein keim unter'm schnee.
Dann klopfte jemand an die t¨¹r
Kam herein, nahm den kleiner und fuhr
...es war der tod

[[  She had a small child
    So weak, like a seed under the snow.
    Then someone knocked at the door,
    Came in, took the small one and left
    ...It was death. ]]

Sagt mir, nacht und wasser
Wo'st mein kind?
Geh mal durch die wälder
Und du findest's.

[[ "Tell me, night and water,
    Where's my child?"
    "Go at once through the woods
    And you shall find" ]]

Die mutter, sie weinte
Und sie lief durch die wälder so tief.
Sie sah ein treibhaus dort fern
Ging dahin, sie sp¨¹rte ihr kind war da.

[[  The mother cried
    And she ran through the woods so deep
    She saw a hothouse in the distance
    Went there, she felt her child was there ]]

Sag mir, weiser gärtner
Wo'st mein kind? [1]
Such mal unter'n blumen
Und du findest's.

[[  "Tell me, wise gardener,
    Where's my child ?"
    "Search under the flowers
    And you shall find" ]]

Sie fand ihr kindlein
Kleiner keim, mit dem puls so schwach.
Dann kam der tod in das treibhaus,
Es blieb kalt, ihre hände kalt wie eis. [3]

[[  She found her child,
    The small little seed, with a pulse so weak.
    Then death entered the hothouse.
    It grew cold, her hands cold as ice. ]]

Hör mal, arme mutter
Dein liebling
Hätte nie gesund und froh gelebt.
Reich mir dieses keimchen, bitte dich
Und sein herzchen sende ruh.

[[  "Listen to me, poor mother
    Your darling
    Would never have a healthy and joyful life.
    Hand me this little seedling, I beg you,
    And put it's heart to rest." ]]


4. Waking Will

The reptiles escaped, who said 'booh'?
Was it me, but who then was I?
What made them fear?
It's dark and it's cold, and I feel so old
I'm going down
I'm going down to chase some reptiles

So autonomic
And you, you interrupt my dream
Yeah, you interrupt me
My old brainstem is talking
And you interrupt my dream
Yeah, you interrupt me

The kites fly up high, I'm free, I run
But from heaven fall the bluebirds
They hit the ground
The sun warms my face, and I feel, and I feel
It ain't the end for all the living
It ain't no end for the living, no!

My intuition
And you, you interrupt my dream
Yeah you, you interrupt me
Deep in here it is hidden
And you interrupt my dream
You interrupt me
You woke me up, I'm forgetting
And you interfere
Yeah you, you interrupt my dream

It's so autonomic
It's so autonomic
It's so autonomic

It's so autonomic
It's so autonomic
It's so autonomic
It's so autonomic


5. Shimmering, Warm and Bright

There's an old, old giant
Sneaking around inside this house
Help move the cupboard
Make a huge barricade
So he won't enter

Draw some life from the sun and the day
We heard a noise, and it took shape
I mean cold, cold blood
Running right through deep inside our veins

What is he gonna tell us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
Shimmering warm on the opposite side
Isn't he gonna tempt us?
Shimmering, warm and bright

We need a helping hand
We have lost our touch
If his shadow appears
We're going to fall apart
I mean we got addicted long time ago
But that spooky, old giant won't withdraw

Give me a sign, oh, a good omen
Give me a sign, oh, a good omen
Give me a sign, oh, a good omen

What if he does resent us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
Shimmering warm on the opposite side
Isn't he gonna tempt us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
Shimmering warm on the opposite side
Isn't he gonna tempt us?
Shimmering, warm and bright
Shimmering warm on the opposite side
Isn't he gonna tempt us?
Shimmering, warm and bright


6. Sleep in Deep

While the cold wind blows
The heroes return
Left are troubled souls
That nothing but yearn
For a better day
For some rightfulness
Will their wounds get healed?

Rest body and mind
Let them sleep, let them sleep in peace
Their minds demand a release
From the dread they hold, oh

Do I need to see
What eyes can not bear?
Do I need to hear
That nobody cares?
For the things I have done
And the things I've learnt
Are now scars in me

Rest body and mind
Let me sleep, let me sleep in deep
And disembody the fear
And the fright, and the fright I hide
But until then I will pray
That I'll hold on to

8. Le temps Dégagé (The Sky Is Clear)

À présent, oui, juste à l'instant
Le temps dégagé
Mes yeux las sont fermés
En regardant les tout petits points
Je m'assoupis, m'assoupis
ça, c'est la folie; ne pas dormir de la nuit

[[  Now, yes, right now
    The sky is clear
    My tired eyes are closed
    From staring at all those tiny dots
    I doze, i doze
    That, it's crazy; not to go to sleep at night ]]

Tu me dis: peut-ítre qu'il faut
Retrouver les sens
Discerner les nuances
Mais comme tu vois; le coup des points
C'est la pleine lune, la pleine lune
Qui m'a faite comme ça et oh-la-la
ça fait du bien
Embrasse-moi!

[[  You say to me: perhaps we should
    Find the meaning
    Discern the shades
    But as you see; the stroke of the dots
    It's the full moon, the full moon
    That made me as i am and "oh-la-la"
    It makes me feel good
    Kiss me! ]]

Si bien
Tu me donne la chair de poule
ça fait du bien
Rien n'est comme la lune qui saoule
ça fait du bien

[[  Very well
    You make me shudder
    It makes me feel good
    Nothing compares to the moon that makes one feel drunk
    It makes me feel good ]]

À présent, oui, just à l'instant
Le temps dégagé
Mes oreilles ont bougé
Et donc bientôt mes ríves se seront
Accomplis, accomplis
Oui, on aurait dit qu'elle est la source
De mon plaisir
Faisons l'amour!

[[  Now, yes right now
    The sky is clear
    My ears are ringing
    Thus, soon, my dreams will
    Come true, come true
    Yes, it would seem to be the cause
    Of my pleasure
    Let's make love! ]]

Si bien
Tu me donne la chair de poule
ça fait du bien
Rien n'est comme la lune qui saoule
ça fait du bien

[[  Very well
    You make me shudder
    It makes me feel good
    Nothing compares to the moon that makes one feel drunk
    It makes me feel good ]]

Si bien
Tu me donne la chair de poule
ça fait du bien
Rien n'est comme la lune qui saoule
ça fait du bien
Si bien
Des illusions d'optique
ça fait rien!
Rien n'est comme ces heures magiques
ça fait du bien

[[  Very well
    You make me shudder
    It makes me feel good
    Nothing compares to the moon that makes one feel drunk
    It makes me feel good
    Very well
    About optical illusions
    It doesn't do anything
    Nothing compares to these magical hours
    They make me feel good ]]


9. Spiderdust

She lived in limbo
Time showed no mercy
Until a man in grey gave her
Doses of a sweet poision

Mmm she got
Mmm she got hoodooed, voodooed
Mmm she got
Mmm she got finally released
She stirred huge cauldrons
With toads and henbane and

Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for haunted lusts
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for the evil-eyed
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for spellbound lusts
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for the demonized

Mmm she got
Mmm she got voodooed, hoodooed
Mmm she got
Mmm she got finally redeemed
She stirred huge cauldrons
With toads and henbane and

Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for haunted lusts
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for the evil-eyed
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for spellbound lusts
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for the demonized

She bred toads
She got burnt

Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for haunted lusts
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for the evil-eyed
Spiderdust, spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for spellbound lusts
Spiderdust!
Hotchpotch for the demonized

Mmm she got
Mmm she got voodooed, hoodooed
Mmm she got
Mmm she got finally redeemed


10. Mornixuur

Between the longest days
I search and wonder
You might come inside my world
To escape the doubts, there ain't no other
Reason nor a purpose

Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
When all is ready, set and done
If our dreams and hopes
Will fall asunder
We are here for a purpose

When our love is alive
We are descendants of love
Alive and awake
We are descendants of love

Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
When all is ready, set and done
If our dreams and hopes
Will fall asunder
We are here for a purpose

When our love is alive
We are descendants of love
Alive and awake
We are descendants of love

Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
The early dawn, the early dawn
Way, oh we are, we are, I say we are

We, we are,
We are descendants of love
When our love is alive
We are descendants of love

Free your mind
Free your mind
Free your mind
The early dawn, the early dawn
Way, oh we are, we are, I say we are

We, we are,
We are descendants of love

We are
