Got an 85 cabin on an 85 hill

Hang on st. christopher on the passenger side
Open it up, tonight the devil can ride

Hang on st. christopher with a barrel house dog
Kick me up mt. baldy throw me out in the fog
Tear a hole in the jack pot drive a stake through his heart
Do a 100 on the grapevine do a jump on the start

Hang on st. christopher now don't let me go
Get me to reno and bring it in low, yeah.

Hang on st. christopher with the hammer to the floor
Put a hi ball in the crank case nail a crow to the door
Get a bottle for the jockey get me a 294
There's a 750 norton bustin' down january's door

Hang on st. christopher on the passenger side
Open it up, tonight the devil can ride

Hang on st. christopher and don't let me go
Get me to reno got to bring it in low

Get 'em all jacked up on whiskey then we'll turn the mad dog loose

Hang on st. christopher on the passenger side
Open it up, tonight the devil can ride on yeah

Oh yeah


2. Straight to the top (Rhumba)

I'm going straight to the top
oh yea up where the air is
fresh and clean
I'm going straight up to the top
if you know me, you know what I mean
I can't let sorrow
try and pull ol'Frankie down
live for tomarrow I have found you
I'm going straight to the top
up where the air is fresh and clean
I know what I will never stop, oh no,
until I know I'm wild and free.
just like a champagne bubble
pop pop pop..
I'm like those birdies
high up in the trees
I can't let sorrow
pull ol'Frankie down
live for tomorrow
I have found you.
I'm going straight up to the top oh yeah
up where the air is fresh and clean.


3. Blow wind blow

Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in
the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
I got
quiet as a church mouse
Put my Raleigh's on
the dashboard
Sugar daddy caught a polocar.
Ain't no solitary
tap dance way down here

Blow wind blow
Wherever you may go
put on your overcoat
take me into the nigth
take me into the nigth
blow me away

I swear I's ridin
on a field mouse
we were dancin' in the slaughterhouse
If you swing along the beltway
then you skid along the all day
cause I went a little crazy
and I sat upon a high chair
And I'm smokin like a diesel
way out here

And if you blow wind blow
Wherever you may go
put on your overcoat
take me away
you gotta take me on into the nigth
Will you take me away on into the nigth?
blow me away
blow me away
you gotta blow it away
blow me away


4. Temptation

Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
everything is made from dreams
time is made from honey slow and sweet
only the fools know what it means
temptation, temptation, temptation
oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist.
I know that she is made of smoke
but I've lost my way
she knows that I am broke
so that I must play
temptation, temptation, temptation
oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist.
Dutch pink and Italian blue
she is there waiting for you
my will has disappeared
now my confusions oh so clear
temptation, temptation, temptation
whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation
I can't resist.


5. Innocent when you dream (Barroom)

The bats are in the belfry
the dew is on the moor
where are the arms that held me
and pledged her love before
and pledged her love before
Chorus:
It's such a sad old feeling
the fields are soft and green
it's memories that I'm stealing
but you are innocent when you dream
when you dream
you're innocent when you dream
Running through the graveyard
we laughed my friends and I
we swore we'd be together
until the day we died
until the day we died
Repeat chorus
I made a golden promise
that we would never part
I gave my love a locket
and then I broke her heart
and then I broke her heart
Repeat chorus


6. I'll be gone

Tonight I'll shave the mountain
I'll cut the hearts from pharoahs
I pull the road off the rise
tear the memories from my eyes
and in the morning I'll be gone
I drink 1000 shipwrecks
tonight I'll steal your paychecks
I paint the sheets across my bed
the birds will all fly from my head
and in the morning I'll be gone
take every dream that's breathing
find every boot that's leaving
shoot all the lights in the cafe
and in the morning I'll be gone
I bet a 1000 dollars
I have a french companion
I tie myself below the deck
I pull the rope around my neck
and in the morning I'll be gone
it takes a life to win her
there is a drum  of bourbon
800 pounds of nitro
his boots are thunder as he plays
there is a stone inside it
tonight his bones will ride it
I'll need a tent to hide it
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone


7. Yesterday is here

If you want money in your pocket
and a top hat on your head
a hot meal on your table
and a blanket on your bed
well today is grey skies
tomorrow is tears
you'll have to wait till yesterday is here
Well I'm leaving on a train
and if you want to stay behind and
wait til I come back again
well today is grey skies
tomorrow is tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here
If you want to go
where the rainbows end
you'll have to say goodbye
all our dreams come true
baby up ahead
and it's out where your memories lie
well the road's out before me
and the moon is shining bright
what I want you to remember
as I disappear tonight
today is grey skies
tomorrow's tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here


8. Please wake me up

I put my chips on her shoulder
running in carnival time
she bought the things that I told her
they made her eyes sparkle and shine
together we'll ring in the new year
I know that she'll be my queen
and if I fall asleep in your arms
please wake me up in my dreams
Her out-fit was all made of vinyl
like nothing that I've ever seen
when our divorces are final
She'll fit right into my scheme
next to the pawnshop's a chapel
I'll show you just what I mean
and if I fall asleep in your arms
please wake me up in my dreams.


9. Franks theme

Dream away the tears in your eyes
Dream away your sorrows
Dream away all your goodbyes
Dream away tomorrow
I promise when the sun comes up
I promise I'll be true
and just like before the band starts to play
they always play your favorite tune
and dream away when everyone's gone
dream away your grey skies too
dream away and nothing is wrong
dreams have wishes that are waiting for you
and up ahead the road is turning
turning for you and me
and just like before
the band starts to play
now there's that twinkle in your eye
and dream away


10. More than rain

It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight
it's more than thunder it's more than thunder
it's more than a swindle this crooked card game
it's more than sad times it's more than sad times
none of our pockets are filled with gold
nobody's caught the bouquet
there no dead presidents we can fold
nothing is going our way
and it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
it's more than woe-be-gotten grey skies now


11. Way down in the hole

When you walk through the garden,
You've gotta watch your back.
Well, I beg your pardon;
Walk the straight and narrow track.

When you walk with Jesus,
He's gonna save your soul.
You've got to keep the Devil;
way down in the hole

He's got the fire and the the fury
At his command.

Well, you don't have to worry
If You hold on to Jesus hand
We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls.

We've got to keep the devil,
Way down in the hole.

All the angels sing 'bout
Jesus' mighty sword
And they shield you with their wings
Keep you close to the Lord
Don't pay heed to temptation
For his hands are so cold
You gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole
Down in the hole
Down in the hole (yeah)
Down in the hole (yeah)
Down in the hole
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

You gotta help me keep the devil
Down in the hole


12. Straight to the top (Vegas)

I'm going straight to the top
I'm going where the air is flesh and clean
I'm going straight up to the top
If you know me, you know what I mean

I can't let Mr. Sorrow try and pull 'ol Frankie down
We live for tomorrow
I've found you
Straigth to the top
I'm going up where the air is fresh and clean

I know I'm never gonna stop,
Until I know, I know I'm wild and free

(Hey)
I'm going straight to the top
and if you know me, you know what I mean

I can't let Mr. Sorrow try and pull me down
I live for tomorrow
I have found you
I'm going straight to the top (wow)
I'm going up where the air is fresh and clean

I can't let Mr. Sorrow pull 'ol Frankie down
He live for tomorrow
I have found you
Straight up to the top (oh yeah!)
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is 
Up where the air is 
Up where the air is fresh and clean

(How about that band?)


13. I'll take New York

I'll tip the newsboy
I'll get a shine
I'll ride that dream
to the end of the line
I'm goin places
I'll get a ride
Up to the Riverside
I gonna take you New York
I'll make it happen
I'll pop the cork
I'm drinking Manhattan
I'll make a splash on the Big Time
that's how I will arrive
Hey, do you have two tens for a five?
You gotta roll out the carpet
Strike up the band
break into the best
champagne when I land
You gotta beat that Parade drum
hit all the bars
I want the moon and stars
I gonna take you New York
I'll make it happen
Blow out the candles
I'm drinking Manhattan
tear off the wrappin
And I know someday
they'll have to name a street after me
right next door to old Franklin D

I'm gonna take you Big Town
Come on New York
Come on move over, Big Town
I'll take New York

Come on Big Town
Come on, get happy, New York
Come on...


14. Telephone call from Istanbul

All night long on the broken glass
Livin in a medicine chest
Mediteromanian hotel back
Sprawled across a roll top desk
The monkey rode the blade on an
Overhead fan
They paint the donkey blue if you pay
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
My baby's coming home today

Will you sell me one of those if I shave my head
Get me out of town is what fireball said
Never trust a man in a blue trench coat
Never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival
Friday's a gem
Die your hair yellow
And raise your hem
Follow me to Beulah's on
Dry Creek Road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed

Will you sell me one of those if I shave my head
Get me out of town is what fireball said
Never trust a man in a blue trench coat
Never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival
Friday's a gem
Die your hair yellow
And raise your hem
Follow me to Beulah's on
Dry Creek Road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed
Take me down to buy a tux
On red rose bear
Got to cut a hole in the day
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
My baby's coming home today

Sell me one of those if I shave my head
Get me out of town is what fireball said
Never trust a man in a blue trench coat
Never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival
Friday's a gem
Die your hair yellow
And raise your hem
Follow me to Beulah's on
Dry Creek Road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed


15. Cold, cold ground

Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafe
Never slept with a dream before he had to go away
There's a bell in the tower
Uncle Ray bought a round
Don't worry 'bout the army in the cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground

Now don't be a cry-baby
When there's wood in the shed
There's a bird in the chimney
And a stone in my bed
When the road's washed out
We pass the bottle around
And wait in the arms of the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground

There's a ribbon in the willow
And a tire swing rope
And a briar patch of berries
Takin over the slope
The cat'll sleep in the mailbox
And we'll never go to town
'Till we bury every dream in the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Gimme a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn
Let it roll down the hill
The piano is firewood
Times square is a dream.
I find we'll lay down together in the cold, cold ground
The cold, cold ground
Cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Call the cops on the Breedloves
Bring a bible and a rope
And a whole box of rebel
And a bar of soap
Make a pile of trunk tires
And burn 'em all down
Bring a dollar with you baby in the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground

Take a weathervane rooster
Throw rocks at his head
Stop talking to the neighbors
Until we all go dead
Beware of my temper
And the dog that I've found
Break all the windows in the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground
In the cold, cold ground


16. Train song

Well I broke down in East Saint Louis
On the Kansas City line
And I drunk up all my money
That I borrowed every time
And I fell down at the derby
The night's as black as a crow
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home

What made my dreams so hollow
Was standing at the depot
With a steeple full of swallows
That could never ring the bell
And I come ten thousand miles away
Not one thing to show
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home

I remember when I left
Without bothering to pack
Don't you know I've been left with
Just the clothes I had on my back
Now I'm so sorry for what I've done
And I'm out here on my own
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home

It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home


17. Innocent when you dream (78)

The bats are in the belfry
The dew is on the moor
Where are the arms that held me
And pledged her love before
And pledged her love before

It's such a sad old feeling
The hills are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you are innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream

I made a golden promise
That we would never part
I gave my love a locket
And then I broke her heart
And then I broke her heart

It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you are innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
Innocent when you dream

Running through the graveyard
We laughed my friends and I
We swore we'd be together
Until the day we died
Until the day we died

It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you are innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream
