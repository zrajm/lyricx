1. The Magic Box I

Clink, clink, clatter, rattle
The penny dropped
Iconized, though slightly slouched he
Raised both his arms,
raised his head

Outside the cabinet there stood a little girl,
goggle-eyed and quite atounded
Gazed at the wizard,
Gazed at the crystal-ball

Dear Mr. Sage, what do you see?
Is it my dream? - It was here with me
Now it is lost
Where can it be?


2. In Zenith

Oh, surely love will come my way
Oh, surely, in time
I'm being in my zenith
The vital youth

The clouds glide by, baby, baby
The clouds and I
Stirred it up into a thunder

Still craving?
I know
It'll get better eventually

In zenith, in zenith
Quiet sleep
In zenith, in zenith

Oh, it is my remedy:
Sunshine - a balcony
Mind and matter
Soil and seed

The birds pass by, baby, baby
The birds up high
Whirled it up into a thunder

Still craving?
I know
Mind you baby, it's mutual
Still craving for love?
Guess you'll find it eventually

In zenith, in zenith
Quiet sleep
In zenith, in zenith
Quiet sleep
Quiet sleep

Still craving?
I know
Mind you baby, it's mutual
Still craving for us?
Guess we'll meet up eventually

Quiet, quiet sleep
Quiet, quiet sleep
Yeah, quiet sleep


3. Free Lunch in the Jungle

I know I'm alive
And I do love lovely dos, do you?
Oh yeah, I guess you do
I love being alive
And I hope that love will see me through
In all the things I do

I like the spice in me, I like the spice in you
I've seen it twice in me and I've seen it twice in you

I know I'm alive
Until all my dreams are all come true
And some things are blue
I know I'm alive, I know I am
'Cause if I was not, I would be damned
And, so I guess, would you
Yeah

I like the spice in me, I like the spice in you
So throw a dice for me and I'll throw a dice for you

Oh, we all cling on tight to pine-tree tops
Oh, we are the lucky stars, lucky stars
Oh, we all cling on tight to pine-tree tops
Oh, we're just a little bit too excited
Little bit too excited for me X2
Je vis avec baloo là-bas
Je vis bien là-bas
Oui on mange ...
...
Understand?

I know I'm alive 'cause I do love lovely dos, do you?
Oh yeah, I know you do
Bien sur
Yo!

I'm in love with life, I know I am and I'll try to keep it spick and span
To let my love shine through

I like the spice in me, I like the spice in you
He put the eyes in me, a little bit the eyes in you

Oh, there's a crocodile beneath the mud
It wants a little snack, a little snack
There's a crocodile beneath the mud
It is a little bit too excited
Little bit too excited for me X2
Je vis avec baloo là-bas
Je vis bien là-bas
Little bit too excited for me
This is too excited for me
Oui on mange ...
Bien sûr pas loin de moi

Oh, when you cling on tight to pine-tree tops
I'd say shake and bend, shake and bend
Oh, when you cling on tight to pine-tree tops
You'll feel a little bit too excited
Little bit too excited for me X2
Ecoute, j'ai deja dit tout ça
Je vis bien là-bas
Little bit too excited for me
This is too excited for me
Oui on mange ...
Pourquoi pas loin de moi ?
Little bit too excited for me
This is too excited for me
Ecoute, j'ai deja dit tout ça
Je vais bien là-bas
Little bit too excited for me
This is too excited for me
Je vis avec baloo là-bas, bas, bas


4. Rumour

This is the morning
When our feelings rise together with the sun
There are the feelings that are yet to be awoken
How many wishes fade to nothing
Once they face reality?
How many wishes turn to grief?
How many wishes going on and on and on and on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ouh, hey, hey
I bless the sunshine
With my love-disease and all my knees and more
I bless the sunshine and no shadows haunt my walls
Blue is a state of mind
Blue makes you colourblind
Beware of it, beware of it

You talk about a rumour
You talk about dead-end streets
About this rumour
Its not the way to think
Talk about a rumour
Then talk about a higher love
You know it won't
It won't satisfy my needs
It won't satisfy my needs
Say ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne

Talk about a rumour

No one expected this
That I should falter in a maudlin sky
No one expected this
But I misjudged and aimed to high
Blue is a sacred place
Where shattered dreams find shelter, well
Blue is a state of mind
Blue makes you colour-blind

You talk about a rumour
You talk about dead-end streets
About this rumour
It's God in me
So, if you talk about a rumour
Then talk about a higher love
You talk about a rumour
When all it takes is simple love
And love and love and love and love
Simple love
And love and love and love and love
You're too high
Blue makes you colour-blind, yeah
Yeah hehe, love ....


5. Sleepwalker

Grandpa got trapped in the walls of mist
He tried to flee and measure out the view from his braincloud
But the higher he climbed, the more they dragged him down

He loved to sing
He didn't dare to talk
He loved to sing but he didn't dare to talk

A woman got injected with the poison from a man
Struggled for a lifetime to wake up and understand
Steady on, sleepwalker
Steady on, sleepwalker

There's so much more than this I swear
There's so much more than this
Would you care?
Know that someone like this could have been spared
Life's worth more than this, I swear

The longer you let it wait it'll catch you up, you up
Whenever you walk away, it'll catch you up, you up
If you do ignore their fates, it'll catch you up, you up
The consequenses of foul play is that it'll catch you up, see?

Boy, it's got to stop, to stop!
Boy, it's got to stop, to stop! S.T.O.P

Steady on, sleepwalker
Steady on, sleepwalker
Sleepwalker

There's so much more than this I swear
Life's worth more than this
Would you care?
No, that someone like this should have been there
Know there's more love to life than this

The longer you hesitate, it'll catch you up, you up
Whenever you look away, it'll catch you up, you up
Don't watch their lives drift away
It'll catch you up, you up
No, the consequences of foul play is that it'll catch you up, see?

Steady on
Steady on
S.T.O.P


6. Bombay

I've been to Bombay
I've seen what a man can do
He climbs up a straight rope
Right up to the clear full-moon

And "boom", he is gone
Yeah, heaven is not that far
And limbs from a body are falling down on the ground

Gee! It must be hard to do
Yes, it is true, yes, it is true
I think the limbs belonged to an orang-outang,
Orang-outang, orang-outang

I've been to Bombay
I've seen what a man can do
He climbs up a straight rope
A monkey is with him too

And "boom", he's gone to heaven
He's mighty daring, mighty,
Right he must be some kind'a guru
He's out of orbit, out of orb...

It seems as if the rope was held by one of the Gods,
One of the Gods
So tight! Not like elephants' trunks
They wobbly-wob, wobbly-wob, wobbly-wob

I've been to Bombay
I've been to Bombay
In my youth
I've been to Bombay
I've been to Bombay
In my youth
YaYaeeaoouth!

And "boom", he's gone to heaven
He's mighty daring, mighty right
He must be some kind'a guru
He's out of orbit, out of orbit
The crowd went hurly-hurly
( No, I would never lie to you )
He never came downn, never came down
(Yes, it is true )
He must have gone to heaven
(yes, it is true )
And out of orbit, out of orbit


7. Paradise

Only for this moment, let me be the one to hold you tight
I'll hush the anguish and the fear with a lullaby
If the stormy waters seize you in your restless sleep, I will safely
pull you out of the deep

Don't ask me why, don't ask me if
Can't you see, you're my blood?
Say you'll put your trust in me although it aches
We'll make the demons go without a trace

Mary, don't go
We'll find paradise in the end
Maybe
Hol on to paradise baby

In a whisper I once heard you vaguely: "I'm in a boat alone in the
raging sea"
We could calm those waves, you and I
We could row the other side
Mary

Hold on

Mary, don't go
We'll find paradise in the end
Maybe
Hold on
It will be paradise one day
Mary, my blood
I will be your side till the end
Marry me my blood and I will be your side till the end, till the end
We could row the other side
Mary


8. Didn't You Know It?

Hey, sibling souls, are you out there?
Children of the earth, where are we going from here?
'Cause it hurts the young to live in the open with so much love to give
But too little to spare

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the moves we make, the moves we make
We stumble and we hesitate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the moves we make, the moves we make

She said I was not to worry
Hadn't seen her since, but was totally convinced
'Till I heard them say; "Didn't you know it?
Mary, poor child, was alone
When she died"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the moves we make, the moves we make
The promises we disengage
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the moves we make, the moves we make

Time for the unfree
Time to rejuvenate the elderly
Time for the unfree
Time to lend a hand

Time to lend a hand
Time to make a stand

So many things I don't want to know
Told a freind one day but he says I'm o.k
'Cause we're born within the x-geberation
Virtually real with a planet to heal

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the moves we make, the moves we make
We fumble and we hesitate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the moves we make, the moves we make

Time for the unseen
Time to eliminate tomorrow's fears
Time for the unseen
Time to make a stand

Do you follow me? No?
Well, it's time to move on and to set our wills free

Fantasy, it's here in me

9. Big Belly Butterflies

I want to give you love but it takes some guts to have and hold with empathy
To coil around you tenderly feels like windows open wide, feels cold, fresh
breeze
So, then why do tears roll down my cheeks, flow and flood the temple of my
body's flesh and bones?

My body's flesh and bones
My body's flesh and bones

I want to give you more than I ever have
Somehow this is not my curse
The air, too thin, too many times recycled feels my big belly butterflies,
feeds, grows too, wild
Do you want to see me cry?
Yeah, head bent, on my knees? No!
You know I have to let you know that I have to let you go

Sixteen rifts inside of me, inside this solid tube, inside is solitude, inside
this solid tube...

Oh hopefully truth will make me free
Fly, you big belly butter, big jelly-belly butterflies

Is solitude
Inside they do
Inside too

My body's flesh and bones
My body's flesh and bones
Free

10. Kiss of Spring

We set our sails and the sorrows passed us by like cherry-trees with
their blossoms all floating through the air

We made a wish while the angels boogalooed around the trees with the
blossoms encircling their hair

My first kiss - joy and bliss
Yes, we should
Touch the flame - Is it sane?
Yes, we should

We set our sails and the shadows stuck ashore like wooden piers
But the blossoms were floating through the air

We kissed the lake while the angels waved and cheered
And so it seemed that the blossoms made garlands in their hair

Oh, my baby - two makes three
Yes, we should
Is it true? - Is it me you woo?
Yes, we should
Yes, we should, should

Oh, tickle, little, tickle, little, tickle, little sire
Hottentotts and motmots will guide 'ya to the dragon and his sapphires

Oh, tickle, little, tickle, little, tickle, little winner
All of us have been a champion swimmer
5, 6, 7 ate 9 for dinner

Oh, my baby - two makes three
Yes, we should
Is it true? - Is it me you woo?
Yes, we should
Yes, we should, should
Into the air...
And the blossoms were floating through the air


11. The Magic Box II

Fly, fly fly with the gale to where the four winds blow
Rise and rise until you've found it

If man got no hopes, then man got no love

Please Mr. Sage, keeper of dreams
Is it somewhere beyond the last sea?
Say it is so and bring it to me

Iconized, though slightly slouched he.
