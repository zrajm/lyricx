1. Black Dog Bliss

There's an air raid look on his face.
There's a bullet loose in his cage.
He's gonna stumble, he's gonna fall.
Here comes the quake head, he's learning to crawl.
Now will he come, now will he survive.
Now will he come come come down alive.
He's comin' naked, he's wearin' a sign.
Don't look at me I was just passin' by.

He got his wings hidden under his skin.
Ten thousand feet and he feels lika a king.
Too many riots too many mistakes.
Too many things to celebrate.

I am the black dog callin'.
I am the black dog howlin'.


2. Kemikal

Feel almost human and warm inside
almost untouchable almost divine.
I watched an angel repaint the sky.
I felt I was watchin' the perfect crime.
Ten seconds of heaven ten seconds of high.
I'm close to perfection. ...tonight.

I had a vision.
I had a dream.
I was John Lydon at double speed.
God save this and God save that.
Everybody save their own sweet ass.
All those temptations.
Just let them be.
Let's spend a lifetime inside this wheel.
Don't change a thing now.
This might be for real.
Let's walk in silence.
Throw away the key.

I'm chemical.
I'm chemical.
I'm chemical.


3. Caveman

I believe in miracles and i believe in God.
I believe in Santa Claus and i believe in love.
I believe in fairy tales.
I do believe in good.
I believe in comedy and i believe in me.
On my coloured days.
I believe in angels and i believe in peace.
I believe in prayers and i believe in dreams.

I believe in reason.
I believe in what I read.
I really do believe.
On my coloured days.
On my coloured days.
I'm a caveman.
I'm a caveman.
I'm a caveman coming out.
I wanna touch I wanna feel.
I pick whatever I might need and I wear a crown.

Cuz' all this was meant for me
all this was meant to be.
On my coloured days.
On my coloured days.
I'm a caveman.
I'm a caveman.
I'm a caveman coming out
Cuz' all this was meant for me
All this was meant to be.
I'm coming out
Cuz' all this was meant to be for me.
I'm a caveman.
I'm a caveman...


4. Celebration!

I'm on a stereophonic high.
I know what i want, but i don't know why.
I am a pagan, I am a saint.
I want a piece of everyone's cake.
This time...
I'll get it right.
This time...
I'm gonna go where the faces shine.
I came to celebrate.

I got a habit and i got it bad.
This is the best habit I have ever had.
I'm hangin' out here in this cartoon
Laughing away my days in this zoo.
Me animal, me in control.
Me watch the humans out on parole.
I am blessed with bein' possessed.
I am blessed bein', bein' possessed.

This time... I'll get it right.
This time... I'm gonna go where the sirens sound.


5. Satellite Lullaby

I'll be invisable.
I'll be a hole in the sky.
I'll be a river.
I'll be a thief.
I'll be I ...I'll be disguised.
I'll swim into quicksand.
I'll fly with the crows if it comes like a bullet, comes like a bullet.
I... I'll just hide and I won't die.
I fear non believers, I fear those who lie.
I cover my ears, cover my eyes.

And I'll fly... wherever I want.
And I'll swim... wherever I feel.
Wearin' my head like a satellite.
Wearin' my head like a lullaby.
Wearin' my head like a satellite ...until they arrive.
I'll be on a night train.
I'll be on a cloud.
I'll be I... until the hammer comes down.

Wearin' my head like a satellite.
Wearin' my head like a lullaby.

6. Zeroes and Ones

Use this invitation.
Use the Autobahn.
Go for world domination.
Everyone's a star.
What you need is a manual.
You push enter and start.
Wire in your main vein.
Plug it into your heart.
Always go the fast lane.
Always travel light.
No speed limitations.
More gigabytes.

New urban spacemen.
Out in no mans land.
New urban dreamtime.
New urban sounds.

Every window is different.
Every window is a sea.
There are borderless nations.
Stick your head in the screen.

New urban playground.
Everyone's devine.
Go for world infiltration.
Hit ten out of nine...


7. Move Like a Menace

I'm on the 40th floor,
I can't see you all.
I see you run around like animals.
More and faster.
I just pray
I got nothin' to say, nothin' to say
never come down
never touch the ground
no elevators goin' down.
This is my bubble, this is my vault
and my bubbles got no doors.

Stuck behind enemy lines.
Stranger in a strange town.
Helicopters all around...
move...
What do you all want from me?
What do you all want from me, want from me?
Everyone's an enemy.
Everyone's a refugee.
Everyone's an enemy enemy...
enemy...
All the pills I took
they hit me today
and they're making the grey day fade away.


8. Youth

I remember the first night I came here
I remember the cold outside
I remember their smiling faces
I remember their nursery rhymes
This is what you get boy
This is what you get
Better learn how to run, boy
Better learn how to run
In a hole, hole, hole

I remember a big white bedroom
With the barbed wired angel asleep
I remember a common foot soldier
Wallpaper made of dreams
I saw a pale imitation
Of whatever was meant to be
I saw a vague silhuette of
Something that was to be me
In a hole, hole, hole, hole

I remember a Babylon burning, boy

I remember a black tongue talking
I remember a dirty smell
I remember silent Sundays
I remember the fear I felt

That's when I learned how to smile, boy
That's when I learned how to smile
That's when I learned how to smile, boy
That's when I learned how to smile

I remember the meat train comin'
I saw the chain gangs pass
I remember the winners and losers
All wearing the same mask

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I remember a Babylon burning, boy
I remember a Babylon burning, boy

Run, run, run, run, you better
Run, run 'cause the bullet's hard
Run, run, you better boy
'Cause the bullet will hit you hard
Run, run 'cause the future's callin'
Run, run 'cause the future's here
Run, run 'cause the future's comin'
Run, run 'cause the future's here
In a hole, hole, hole, hole

I remember a Babylon burning in hell
I remember a Babylon burning in hell

Don't send me no photos of it
Don't send me no letters, no
There's really no need to remind me
There's really no need at all
'Cause nobody knows any answers
No, nobody knows any facts
Everybody's good and evil
Everybody's good and bad
In a hole, hole

I remember a Babylon burning, boy
I remember a Babylon burning, boy
I remember a Babylon burning, boy
I remember a Babylon burning, boy

I remember it as a black mark
I remember it clear as mud
I remember the questions I had
The things that I never understood


9. White, White, White

White boy picking up low life gods
Rippin' up, rippin' up, dirty old scars
White men come, come in grand parades
Celebratin' heroes day

We're white
We're programmed
We're white
We're programmed
White trash
Piece of white trash

We're all happy, we're all look-alikes
We're all happy, we're all parasites
Down in the well of the human race
We're all uniformed and garbage faced

We're white
We're programmed
We're white
We're programmed
White trash
(Uniformed and garbage faced)
Piece of white trash, white trash

Oh, I'm from the land of milk and clean
Where nothing never, ever gets mean
Oh, I grew up in silly schools
I grew up to be a silly old fool

I'm white
I'm programmed
I'm white
I'm programmed
I'm white
I'm programmed
I'm white
I'm programmed
Piece of white trash, white trash
Piece of white trash
Piece of white trash


10. Monster Song

Here comes the rush, boy
Here comes the curse
This is me and I'm all dressed up in dirt
I'm in a sewer
I'm in a hole
I'm doing things I'm not supposed to do
This ain't no party
This ain't no smile
When nothing's sacred there's no lullabies

There's a monster in me (in me)
I can feel it's alive (alive)
There's a monster in me (in me)
I gotta keep it inside (inside)

Here comes the demons
Here comes the lies
When nothing's sacred there's nowhere to hide
I'm in a quick sand
I'm heavy lead
It's all black, I don't know what I said.

There's a monster in me (in me)
I can feel it's alive (and I'm all dressed like a riot)
There's a monster in me (in me)
I gotta keep it inside (and I'm all dressed like a riot)

There's a monster in me (in me)
I can feel it's alive
(alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive)

I come a-crawlin'
I'm on the floor
I come a-crawlin', I come like a sore
Feel like a car crash
It's all a blur
Feel like a car crash, it really hurts
Here comes the demons
Here comes the lies
This is me and I'm all dressed like a riot

There's a monster in me (in me)
I can feel it's alive (and I'm all dressed like a riot)
There's a monster in me (in me)
I gotta keep it inside (and I'm all dressed like a riot)

There's a monster in me (in me)
I can feel it's alive (and I'm all dressed like a riot)
There's a monster in me (in me)
I gotta keep it inside (and I'm all dressed like a riot)

There's a monster in me (in me)
There's a monster in me (and I'm all dressed like a riot)
There's a monster in me
There's a monster in me (and I'm all dressed like a riot)


11. Takin' War Out of Men

When there's nothing left to ride.
There's a light that comes to blind me
and it will take the weak and tired me to sleep.
I don't want it but I need.
I need to rest my head in dreams.
It takes time...
takin' war out of men.
It takes time...
takin' war out of men.

Leave the panic, leave the fear.
Shut my eyes and shut my head.
 Shut my eyes and let the outside disappear.
This time I need it.
This time I need it really bad.

It takes time...
takin' war out of men.
