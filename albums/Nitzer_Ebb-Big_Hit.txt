1. Cherry Blossom

Cherry blossom is falling
Cherry blossom is on its way out
Hear a new world is calling
It hears me too and it wants me to shout it out
But nothing is changing
It goes around, I'm left with no doubt
It goes around, I'm left with no doubt
That nothing is changing
String you along until you are devout

Cherry blossom is falling
Cherry blossom is falling
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah falling
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah falling

Cherry blossom is falling
Cherry blossom is soon to be through
Say a new world is dawning
But winter comes and soon as summer is through, it's true
Winter is upon you
No warmth is left for all but a few
No warmth is left for all but a few
Winter is upon you
It's left you cold frozen all that I knew, I know

Cherry blossom is falling

Cherry blossom has already gone

Same words, singing the same old song
I feel like I'm shaking
Round and round I know that it won't be long
Round and round I know that it won't be long
I feel like I'm shaking
Must be okay coz how can it all be wrong

2. Hear Me Say          

Cigarette smoke's hanging on my tears
Clouding up my mind like its fears
I'm leaving you
You want me to
But how
I got no shame
So call my name
Call now

Just hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
Don't turn away
Hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
Don't push away

Another tear, another day
Another year and I'll say
There's nothing left for me
And though it's clear that I'll pay
There's a fear that I'll say
I'll stay
Yeah, pick up that knife
And cut up my life
There's nothing you can't touch
So if you see some part
That you think may start
Don't stop

Hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
Don't turn away
Hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
Don't push away

I've turned into something
A puppet on your string
I don't know myself
Is that a part of your stealth
I know what you do
When I say this to you
It means nothing at all
You are deaf to my call
I know what to do
I am turning from you
Love's been drummed out of me
My love is deaf to your plea

Just hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
I've turned away
hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
I've pushed away
Hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
I've turned away
Hear me say
Yeah, hear me say
I've pushed away


3. Kick It              

See a man jumping in
With both feet and his eyes closed
See a dog chasing his tail
In a never ending circle
See yourself in the mirror
Is what you see what you get?
See me, is it reality?
Or someone you never met?

Sometimes I feel it's taking me nowhere
Sometimes I feel my actions are not mine
Sometimes I feel it's taking me nowhere
Sometimes I'm taken by madness divine

If only you could know my secret life
The things that I hide with my lying eyes
Your trust that I breach with my every stride
The depths that I reach when I fall inside
And when I'm on my knees
I'd do anything, anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it
I'd do anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it

See a man running away
From what there is no escape from
See a man hiding
His face from the undeniable truth
See yourself in the mirror
Are you looking for mercy?
See, the thing is
That ain't me, that ain't me
That ain't me, that ain't me
That ain't me, that ain't me, no
That ain't me, that ain't me
That ain't me, no
That ain't me, that ain't me
That ain't me, no
That ain't me, that ain't me
That ain't me, no

If only you could know my secret life
The things that I hide with my lying eyes
Your trust that I breach with my every stride
The depths that I reach when I fall inside
And when I'm on my knees
I'd do anything, anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it
I'd do anything, anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it

See a man jumping in
With both feet and his eyes closed
See a dog chasing his tail
In a never ending circle
See yourself in the mirror
Is what you see what you get?
See me, is it reality?
Or someone you never met?

Sometimes I feel it's taking me nowhere
Sometimes I feel my actions are not mine
Sometimes I feel it's taking me nowhere
Sometimes I'm taken by madness divine

If only you could know my secret life
The things that I hide with my lying eyes
Your trust that I breach with my every stride
The depths that I reach when I fall inside
And when I'm on my knees
I'd do anything, anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it
I'd do anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it, kick it


4. I Thought

Lost you under my bed
Hid and over your head
Moved away from our town
Ask me what has been found
But don't tell me nothing
Won't tell you nothing
I know there's something out there
Someone who I can take care
Don't tell me
Don't tell me

Stars and moon are up late
Sun is sealing their fate
Time to let out a sigh
Sweet, sweet child will always ask why
So don't tell her nothing
She knows that something's out there
Someone that she can take care
Don't tell her
Don't tell her

I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew I'd go away
I thought you knew I'd go away
I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew, I thought
I thought you knew I'd go away
I thought you knew
I know
I know
I know


5. Floodwater           

There was something in the way that the day broke
Thunder rumbled in a darkened sky
Wind in your hair, rain on your face
Fire in your eyes with your head held high
I felt no pain as you walked away
I felt no pain, it was no surprise
And I had to say that I know there's
No such thing as a free ride, Yeah
There's no such thing as a free ride, Yeah

I could see
I could see clouds coming
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds breaking
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater

Yeah
Yeah

There was something in the way that our hearts flowed
Locked in the rhythm no need to try
There was something in the way that they grew cold
When the rain came and our innocence died
When the rain it came and we had to pay
Had to pay for the free ride
When the rain it came and we had to say
Out loud what we felt down inside
And we had to say that we knew there's
No such thing as a free ride, yeah
That there is no such thing as free ride, yeah
There's no such thing as a free ride, yeah

I could see
I could see clouds coming
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds breaking
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds coming
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds breaking
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater

Warm, like home, warm, like summers we were warm
Like home, warm, like summers we had known
And shared and cherished
Back when we used to care about each other
And the feelings that we shared as
Hand in hand until we said
There's no such thing as a free ride, yeah
There's no such thing as a free ride, yeah
There's no such thing as a free ride, yeah
There's no such thing as a free ride, yeah

I could see
I could see clouds coming
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds breaking
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds coming
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater
I could see
I could see clouds breaking
And I knew we'd soon be treading floodwater


6. Border Talk     

I was in a van
A cold day in January stopped sliding by
They wanted to know
"Where ya from? Where ya heading?"
Just everything I knew
Which is nothing, still isn't
A jet came to a halt
Not far to fly
More questions than hours wasted in the air
"Who? Where? Why?"

Border talk
Cross country walk
Take my hand
No friends to speak of
In border talk

Another wheels story
Stepped outta the bus
The dogs were real hungry that day
As you can imagine
We were mostly clean
Huh! Mostly
But they couldn't wait to ask us
Like I say mostly
"What you been smokin' boy?"

500 should cover that, shouldn't it?
Of course it did

I'm just saying
You can be a no man in anyone's land
Unless you're the diplomatically immunised
You're someone to be scrutinised
By governments in arms not opened nearly
As wide as their mouths
Blabbing about freedom
But freedom isn't their language
They don't speak that at all

Border talk
Cross country walk
Take my hand
Border talk
Cross country walk
Take my hand
No friends to speak of
In border talk
No friends to speak of
In border talk


7. In Decline      

Well now what a surprise
You're full of shit and lies
But the world keeps spinning
You are just a clown
Inside a circus town
But the tears keep rolling
You tired controlling our lives
Tried using up all over drive
But our mind keep blowing and growing
Nothing's gonna stop
Nothing can stop
Nothing's gonna stop

You're old with rules
We're not your tools
Fuck your design
You're in delcing

Now you're nice and warm
Inside your uniform
But this storm has taken its hold
Through your thin disguise
Think we don't realise
You're young until you get old
We'll keep looking round
For where you'll be found
Because the weak just want to be told
Nothing's gonna stop
Nothing we can stop
Nothing's gonna stop

You're old with rules
We're not your tools
Fuck your design
You're in decline

Don't you remember when
Think of now and then
Don't you remember when
If you've nothing to say
I'll push you away
If you're too tired to live
Then there's nothing to give

You're old with rules
We're not your tools
Fuck your design
You're in decline


8. Living Out Of A Bag 

I'm living out of a bag
Life comes and goes
But I did not know
No use thinking 'bout
What I never had
Don't suck for me
Because It's letting me free

I'm heading out across the sea
I want the land and you alone with me
So step behind the wheel we'll drive through the gloom
Come sit down next to me and we'll try
Breathe in the fumes that we leave

If I open up the sky you push through the trees
I'm kicking up a storm because I do what I please
To be myself so please yourself
Hey if I wanted to hurt you
I'd say you've got no clue
But I save that for people who know
You know the things that we make
Are the things that they take
As they try to forsake our lives
I wanted to share it with you but

I'm living out of a bag
Life comes and goes but I did not know
No use thinking 'bout what I never had
Don't suck for me
Because it's letting me free

We're living out of a bag
Nothing and no-one held me back
Walk out on me but don't run
Nothing compares with our lives

Kept a rolling stone I've rolled through the dirt
Never once been clean I never wanted to hurt
The life around where I am found
But if there's treasures inside
Then I can't be relied
Not to show the world what can be done
I'll show you how to be free

I'm living out of a bag
Life comes and goes but I did not know
No use thinking 'bout what I never had
Don't suck for me
Because it's letting me free
Is it letting me free?
Is it letting me free?


9. Boy         

Oh boy boy
What's that you heard
Oh boy boy
That's just absurd
Oh my boy
Of course I do do do
Oh my boy from me to you

But people will say things
That are gonna run from you
Coz people and places
That confound you

Oh boy, oh boy
Oh boy, oh boy

Oh boy, boy
Get what's deserved
Oh boy, boy
Not just what's served

Oh my boy
What you must think think think
Oh my boy
I will not sink sink sink

Cos people and places
Are gonna run from you
Unless words meets faces
That confound you

Oh boy, oh boy
Oh boy, oh boy
Oh boy, oh boy

I watch you play
Hear the words you say
You are so strong
Tell me am I wrong?

Oh boy boy
They'll turn your head
Oh boy boy
You'll wish I'm dead
Oh my boy
I love you so so so
Oh my boy
I had to go go go

Coz people reject it
It don't make it so
If we can protect it
We can learn how to grow

Oh boy, oh boy
Oh boy, oh boy
I watch you play
hear the words you say
You are so strong
Tell me am I wrong?


10. Our Own World    




We'll never be broken
Not like the morning
When they sky
Through the night comes yawning
No indecision faded at last
Too late to change our past
So I look to you
As you look to me
Until finally
We can both see

Under, over inside us
We're in our own world

Coming through the darkness
Up across the ocean
We fall
In deep emotion
This understanding
Though we're not together
Naked but our hearts laid bare
But I think of you
As you think of me
Until illogically
You're here with me

Under, over inside us
We're in our own world

Shut them out
We're gonna scream and shout
Gonna shut them out
Gonna scream and shout
Gonna shut them out
Gonna scream and shout
We'll shut them out
They'll scream and shout
We'll shut them out
They'll scream and shout
She'll shut them out
They'll scream and shout
We'll shut them out
They'll scream and shout, shout, shout
We'll shut them out

This is eternal
this is the future
Love's running wild
Like a creature
Can't undermine us
Or move a mountain
We shall always remain
I'm touching you inside
You're touching me inside
Until eventually
There's nowhere to hide

Under and over inside us
We're in our own world
We're in our own world
In our own world, in our own world
