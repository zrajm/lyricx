1. Fitness to Purpose

In the battle, in the bed
In the battle, in the bed

The pair is in heat, the heat
The pair is in heat, the heat
The heat of flesh
The heat of flesh

And the mark
Of your nails
And the salt
On your lips

The mark
Of your nails
The salt
On your lips
The mark
Of your nails
The salt
On your lips

They came between us
They came between us

And the bodies flow
And the bodies twist
Well this flame is on
While the light is on

In the battle, in the bed
In the battle, in the bed

The pair is in heat, the heat
The pair is in heat, the heat
The heat of flesh
The heat of flesh

And your head
Flies back
Your head
Flies back
To the pillow
To the heat

Your head
Flies back
Your head
Flies back
To the pillow
To the heat
To the pillow
To the heat
To ecstasy
To ecstasy
Ecstasy, the battleground
Ecstasy, the battleground

In the battle, in the bed
In the battle, in the bed

The pair is in heat, the heat
The pair is in heat, the heat
The heat of flesh
The heat of flesh

And the mark
Of your nails
And the salt
On your lips

The mark
Of your nails
The salt
On your lips
The mark
Of your nails
The salt
On your lips

They came between us
They came between us

And the bodies flow
And the bodies twist
Well this flame is on
The light is on

And your head
Flies back
Your head
Flies back
To the pillow, to the heat
To the pillow, to the heat
To ecstasy
To ecstasy
Ecstasy, the battleground
Ecstasy, the battleground
Form
And our foul sounds
Form
And our foul sounds
From battle familiar
Battle familiar

We'll do it again
We'll do it again

In the battle, in the bed
In the battle, in the bed

The pair is in heat, the heat
The pair is in heat, the heat
The heat of flesh
The heat of flesh
And your nails
And your lips
And your flesh
And the heat

Your nails
Your lips
Your flesh
The heat
Your nails
Your lips
The flesh
Your heat
Your nails
Your lips
Your flesh
The heat

In the battle, in the bed
In the battle, in the bed

Do it again
We'll do it again
Again

We are the boys
We are the big boys
We're so strong
We're so pure
We know we are
We know we are

Won't you
Come and join us
In our playground
It's a violent playground
Such a violent playground

We're going out to play
There's no fun at home
No one can stop us
We play for real
We play for power

Now we can grow up
We must never get old
It's not allowed
Now we can play
Everywhere
Everywhere

Won't you
Come and join us
In our playground
It's a violent playground
Such a violent playground

We've got new toys
The old ones are worn out
We can change the world
We will play with the world
With the world

Won't you
Come and join us
In our playground
It's a violent playground
Such a violent playground
Such a violent playground
Such a violent playground

8. Let Beauty Loose

What is better than giving ourselves
You and me
You and flesh
Touching for sweet love
Loving for wet flesh
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
Take nothing
Forever, and ever, and ever
Let beauty loose
Let beauty loose
Brothers, sisters, brothers, sisters
Don't force the dance
Don't force the dance
We'll dance 'till we fall
We'll dance 'till we fall
Glisten, glisten, glisten little children
Glisten, glisten, glisten little children
Glisten, glisten, glisten little children
Don't listen when they tell you
There's no despair
There's no despair
There's no despair
Glisten, glisten, glisten little children
There's no despair
There's no despair
There's no despair
