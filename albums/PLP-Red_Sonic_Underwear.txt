[instrumental]


2. Das Neue Konzept

Need a new religion
I need a new you
Need a new city
I need a substitute

Need a fuel injection
I need new chemistry
Need a new prescribtion
I need a new me

Me... I need
I'm in a mess
Me... I need
I need another head

I need a fire engine
I need to get away
I need a helicopter
I need to relocate

Need to be re-cycled
A waste disposal treat
Need a fast mutation
I need a new me

Me... I need
I'm in a mess
Me... I need
I need another head

I need a transformation
I need more megabytes
Need to break out
In a true snake plissken style

Need a new religion
I need to confess
Blow me up to heaven
I need another head

Me... I need
I'm in a mess
Me...


3. Warzaw

Life is a dustbin, life is a whore
Life is a party lets climb up the walls
Lets celebrate nothin' at all
Spend a whole lifetime, waitin' for more

Let's buy a new mercedes and go for a ride
Worship the new gods while the old dies
Ask me no questions I'll tell no lies
Working class heroes partners in crime

Life is a picknick on a factory floor
This is your garden of eden and more
This is the real thing, this is the score
This is where money are learning to crawl

Won't you come down to warzaw
Celebrate nothin' at all
Won't you come down to warzaw
Celebrate nothin' at all...

In... warzaw... in... warzaw...


4. 2000 Ways of Gettin Drunk

I'm the inner city zombie
I'm on tin canned energy

A waste age generated creep

I'm the inner city zombie
Demon days are here again

Every bar is heaven sent

Today there are two thousand ways of gettin drunk

I'm the inner city zombie
Everyday is halloween
I'm the inner city zombie
I drive a car like jimmy dean

I'm the inner city zombie
Empty bank accounts a curse
I'm the inner city zombie
Empty bottles even worse

Today there are 2000 ways of gettin' drunk


5. G.O.D. [On Vacation]

Never mind those missile nights
Everything feels so divine
Morons gets a nobel prize
Armageddons one big smile

Watch commercials get a kick
Buy a gun get stinkin' rich
Ride in limos star in soaps
Armageddons such a joke

Urban jungle human apes
Hevily into real estate
Everone dressed like a bum
Armageddons... just for fun


6. Animals

Animal instinct. animal high
Animal kisses. animalized
Animal me. animal you
Animal hungry. feed me tonight

Animal skin makes animal lust
Animal wired, animal must
Animal naked, animal rites
Babylon's burnin' and I'm animal wild

Animals... animals... hungry

Animal cages. animal tribes
Animal faces. d.humanized
Animal flesh. animal jaws
Animal bodies crawling the floor

Animal city. animal streets
Animal centurys. second hand breed
Animal woman. animal man
Everyones happy in animal land

Animal hungry, feed me tonight
Animal hungry, hungry, hungry

Animal cages. animal tribes
Animal faces. d.humanized
Animal flesh. animal jaws
Animal bodies crawlin' the floor

Animal city animal streets
Animal centurys. second hand breed
Animal woman. animal man
Everyones happy in animal land

Animal hungry, feed me tonight
Animal hungry, hungry, hungry


7. His Head Spinnin' Off

Candy red
Candy blue
Candy candy I want you

His head spinnin' off
He's losing controle

Candy white
Candisque
I want candywine

His head spinnin' of


8. Good Morning

[instrumental]


9. War In My Livin' Room

I'm the inner city zombie
I'm on tin canned energy
I'm the inner city zombie
Waste age generation chic

I'm the inner city zombie
Every bar is heaven sent
I'm the inner city zombie
I eat dogs and now payed rents

I'm the inner city zombie
Every day is halloween
I'm the inner city zombie
Hear me howlin' through the streets
Bombed out seven days a week
Empty bankaccounts a curse

Can't think of anythingworse
It's an enemy
It's the worst
Life can't really get much worse

I got big enemies
Empty bankaccounts are hell
My bankaccounts my enemy

I got one big enemy
Every bar is heaven sent
Dog food days and even payed rents


10. Discussing the Artist in Pain

[instrumental]


11. Pig Machine

I read it in your pigface
I read it in your smile
I read it in your paper
I read it in your lies

You're a waitin' nightmare
And you deliver pain
You're a psychopath and you are
You are insane

Pig machine
Open up your door
Pig machine
Electronic war
Pig machine
Open up your door
You're a pig machine

I came to face your insults
I came to read my rights
I came to see you suffer and I
I came to see your eyes

Don't need the ten commandments
I don't need the law
You are a marionette and you are
You are a whore

Pig machine
Open up your door
Pig machine
Electronic war
Pig machine
Open up your door
You're a pig machine

Your lies; your lies
Your lies are so bizarre [x2]

I am the pig commander
I go for the throat
I use sabotage and I use
I use force

Pig machine
Open up your door
Pig machine
Electronic war
Pig machine
Open up you whore
You're a pig machine


12. Skinny n White

Skinny white man
In need of a tan
Skinny white man
Chaos in command

Skinny white man
Big concrete head
Skinny white man
Motor burnin' red

Welcome to my world

Skinny white man
Totally blind
Speedin' through time
Don't see no signs

This time for real
Hands on the wheel
Get inside
This is take off time

Welcome to my world

Welcome to my world
Wave goodbye
That concrete head
Need a redesign

3 laps to go
They wave the flag
Skinny white man
Tryin' to stay on track

Welcome to my world


13. The Other Life Form

You got a strange disease

You always disagree

And I'm outside and I'm lookin' in
Outside, lookin' in
And it's your world, and I'm lookin' in
And it's your world, and I'm lookin' in

And I know...
Your the other life form

You got something on me

You're like an alien breed

And I'm outside...


14. The Complete Guide [Immitating a bulldozer on a 24 track tapemachine]

The rich
The sick
The new sensations

I love
You love
We love

The hypes
The smiles
The information

The laws
The wars
Determination

The trance
The chants
New dimensions

I love
You love
We love

The brave
The same
The happy nation

The waves
The chains
The radiation

A universe where anything is possible
A universe where everyting is free
