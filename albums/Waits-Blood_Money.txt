1. Misery is the River of the World

Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
The higher that the monkey can climb
the more he shows his tail
Call no man happy 'til he dies
There's no milk at the bottom of the pail
God builds a church
The devil builds a chapel
Like the thistles that are growing
'round the trunk of a tree
All the good in the world
You can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me
If there's one thing you can say
About Mankind
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitch fork
But it always comes roaring back again

For want of a bird
The sky was lost
For want of a nail
A shoe was lost
For want of a life
A knife was lost
For want of a toy
A child was lost

And misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World

Everybody Row! Everybody Row!

2. Everything Goes to Hell

Why be sweet, why 
be careful, why be kind?
A man has only one thing on his mind
Why ask politely, why go lightly, why say
please?
They only want to get you on your knees
There are a few things I never could believe

A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...

Laissez-faire mi amour, se la vie
Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea?
The world don't care what a soldier does in the town
It's all hanging in the windows by the pound

I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...

I only want to hear your purr and to hear you moan
there is another man who brings the money home
I don't want dishes in the sink
Please don't tell me what you feel or what you think
There are few things I never could believe...

A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...

Everything goes to hell, anyway...


3. Coney Island Baby

Every night she comes
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest
Man in the town
She's a rose, she's the pearl
She's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

She's a princess, in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

Every night she comes
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest
Man in the town
She's a rose, she's the pearl
She's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

She's a princess, in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me

She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

4. All the World is Green

I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea
To have a better life
Marie you are the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings

Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world is green

The face forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The question begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green

Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
Can we bring back the old days again
When all the world is green

The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves
When all the world is green

Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
Can we bring back the old days again
When all the world is green

He is balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves
When all the world is green


5. God's Away on Business

I'd sell your heart to the junkman baby
For a buck, for a buck
If you're looking for someone to pull you out of that ditch
You're out of luck, you're out of luck

The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking

There's leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge
Killers, thieves, and lawyers

God's Away, God's away
God's away on Business. Business.
God's Away, God's Away
God's Away on Business. Business.

Digging up the dead with a shovel and a pick
It's a job, it's a job
Bloody moon rising with a plague and a flood
Join the mob, join the mob
It's all over. It's all over. It's all over.

There's a leak, there'a a leak in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers

God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business
God's away, God's away, God's away on Business

Goddamn there's always such a big temptation
To be good, To be good
There's always free cheddar in a mousetrap, baby
It's a deal, it's a deal

God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.

I narrow my eyes like a coin slot baby,
Let her ring, let her ring

God's Away, God's Away
God's Away on Business.
Business..........

6. Another Man's Vine

Bougainvillea's bloom and wind
Be careful mind the strangle vines
The rose is climbing over the blind
'Cause the sun is on the other side
The bees will find their honey
The sweetest every time

Around a Red Rose
I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine

Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends

I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine


7. Knife Chase

[[ instrumental ]]


8. Lullaby

Sun is red; moon is cracked
Daddy's never coming back
Nothing's ever yours to keep
Close your eyes, go to sleep
If I die before you wake
Don't you cry, don't you weep

Nothing's ever as it seems
Climb the ladder to your dreams
If I die before you wake
Don't you cry, don't you weep
Nothing's ever yours to keep
Close your eyes, go to sleep


9. Starving in the Belly of a Whale

Life is whittled
Life's a riddle
Man's a fiddle that life plays on
When the day breaks, and the earth quakes
Life's a mistake all day long
Tell me, who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get out alive

Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In a crooked ol' world

Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly of a whale
Oh, you're
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale

Don't take my word
Just look skyward
They that dance must pay the fiddler
Sky is darkening
Dogs are barking
But the caravan moves on
You tell me who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get get out alive

Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In the crooked 'ol world

Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly of a whale
Oh, we're
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale

As the crow flies
It's there the truth lies
At the bottom of the well
E-o-leven, goes to heaven
Bless the dead here as the rain falls
Don't trust a bull's horn
A doberman's tooth
A runaway horse or me
Don't be greedy, don't be needy
If you live in hope you're
Dancing to a terrible tune

Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly of a whale
Oh, we're
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale


10. The Part You Throw Away

You dance real slow
You wreck it down
Then you walk away, you turn around
What did that old blonde gal say?
That is the part...
You throw away

I want that beggars eyes
A winning horse
And a tidy Mexican divorce
St. Mary's prayers
Houdini's Hands
And a barman who always
Understands

Will you loose the flowers
Hold on to the vase
Will you wipe all those teardrops
Away from your face
I can't help thinking
As I close the door
I have done all of this
Many times before

But the bone must go
The wish can stay
The kiss don't know
What the lips will say
Forget I've hurt you
Put stones in our bed
And remember to never
Mind instead

Well all of your letters
Burned up in the fire
Time is just memory
mixed in with Desire
That's not the road it is
Only the map...I say
gone just like matches
from a closed down cabaret

In a Portuguese Saloon
a fly is circling around the room
You'll soon forget the tune that you play
'Cause that is the part...
You throw away
Oh, that is the part...
You throw away


11. Woe

The ribbon round you neck
Against your skin it's pale as bone
It is my favorite thing you've worn
The band is playing our song
And we won't go home, 'til morn


12. Calliope

[[ instrumental ]]


13. A Good Man is Hard to Find

Well, I always play Russian Roulette in my head
It's seventeen black or twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter, how far from the pew
I will always remember to forget about you

A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
And my favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red

A long dead soldier looks out from the frame
No one remembers his war, no one remembers his name
Go out to the meadow, scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here, and nothing will grow

A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
And my favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color,
my favorite color is,
my favorite color is red
