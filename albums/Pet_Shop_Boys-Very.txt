1. Can You Forgive Her?

Another night with open eyes
Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love, and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love, and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she
claims

So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughing stock
Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you, and even in bed
Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead

So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish!
(That's childish, so childish!)

Remember when you were more easily led
Behind the cricket pavillion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

It was love, and now you can't pretend
You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's bad enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
And ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish!


2. I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing

Ask me why,
I say it's most unusual
How can I even try to explain
Why today I feel like dancing
Singing like lovers sing
When I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing?
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing

Ask me when, (ta ra ra ra)
I say it started when I met you (ta ra ra ra ra ra)
And ever since then I knew that the past couldn't last
For right now, I think I'm running
A race that I know I'm gonna win
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing

If people say I'm crazy, I tell 'em that it's true
Let them watch with amazement
Say it won't last beyond breakfast
It's a phase he's going through
Denigrate or speculate on what I'm going through
Because it isn't the sort of thing I would normally do

Ask me what, (ta ra ra ra)
I say I think it's good for you (ta ra ra ra ra)
Believe it or not, I know where it's all leading to
I feel like taking all my clothes off
Dancing to the Rite of Spring
And I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing
I wouldn't normally do this kind of -
This kind of thing


3. Liberation

Take my hand,
I've changed my mind again
Really, I believed it true
That all who fell in love were foolish
But I was wrong,
I've learned that lesson well
All the way back home at midnight
You were sleeping on my shoulder

Take my hand,
Don't think of obligations
Now, right now,
Your love is liberation 

To free in me
The trust, I never dared
I always thought the risk too great
But suddenly, I don't hesitate, so

Take my hand,
Don't think of complications
Now, right now,
Your love is liberation
Liberation

Ta ra ra ra ra ra
Ta ra ra ra ra ra

The night, the stars
Our light shone through the dark
All the way back home at midnight
You were sleeping on my shoulder

Take my hand,
Don't think of hesitation
Now, right now,
Your love is liberation
Liberation

Ta ra ra ra ra ra
Ta ra ra ra ra ra

Ta ra ra ra ra ra

Back home at midnight
All the way back home at midnight


4. A Different Point of View

When I'm sitting so close to you
There's only one thing that I wanna do
But I know what you're likely to say
That I'm going about it the wrong way

We can't agree about anything
Where to go or even where we've been
And I know what you're likely to do
Say that I've never care about you

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

You don't believe a single word I say
If I'd say black was white, you'd say it was grey
But in spite of been treated this way
I still dream of you all night and day

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

Just this once
Just say yes
Please

You've got a clever way of haunting me
I'm never scared, but you're still daunting me
'Cause I know what you're likely to say
And I know that you'll get your own way

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view


5. Dreaming of the Queen

Dreaming of the Queen
Visiting for tea
You and her and I
And Lady Di

The Queen said: &quot;I'm aghast
Love never seems to last
However hard you try&quot;
And Di replied

That there are no more lovers left alive
No one has survived
So there are no more lovers left alive
And that's why love has died
Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened to me and you

Then carriages arrived
We stood and said goodbye
Diana dried her eyes
And looked surprised

For I was in the nude
The old Queen disapproved
But people laughed and asked
For autographs

And there were no more lovers left alive
No one had survived
So there were no more lovers left alive
And that's why love had died
Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened to me and you

I woke up in a sweat
Desolate

For there were no more lovers left alive
No one had survived
So there were no more lovers left alive
And that's why love had died
Yes, it's true
Look, it's happened to me and you


6. Yesterday When I was Mad

Darling, you were wonderful, you really were quite good
I enjoyed that, though, of course, no one understood
A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue
They couldn't understand your sense of humour like I do

You're much too kind
I smiled with murder on my mind

Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting, I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me

You have a certain quality, which really is unique
Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak
It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud
Of course it's all on tape, but no one will find out

You hated me too
But not as much as I hated you

Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting, I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me

Then, when I was lonely
I thought again
And changed my mind

Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners
And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner
And someone said: &quot;It's fabulous you're still around today,
You've both made such a little go a very long way&quot;

Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting, I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me

Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting, I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me

Then, when I was lonely
I thought again
And changed my mind


7. The Theatre

(Yeah)

(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu)

(Yeah)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu)

(Yeah)
(Yeah)

It's another world here
The streets are gleaming
I was even dreaming
That they're paved with gold

Seventeen, at half past ten
All the crowds are surging past
An electric display

There's another world here
Below shop windows
Upon the pavement
Where you wave goodbye

Boys and girls
Come too roost
&gt;From Northern parts
And Scottish towns
Will we catch your eye?

While you pretend not to notice 
All the years we've been here
We're the bums you step over
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah)
(Yeah)

It's another world here
Somebody is singing (Yeah)
I was only wishing
For a bit of cash

&gt;From a patron of the arts
Or at least the phantom of the opera
Will I catch your eye?

While you pretend not to notice 
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
All the years we've been here
We're the bums you step over
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah)
(Yeah)

(Ha ha ha ha...)
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 
(Everybody) 

Pavarotti in the park
Then you walked back up the Strand
Did you catch my eye?

And then pretend not to notice 
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
All the years we've been here
We're the bums you step over
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah)
(Yeah)

In the end, you pretend
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
'Cause it's so much easier
We're the bums you step over
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
As you leave the Theatre (Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu 
Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)

We're the bums you step over
(Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu Tu ru tu tu tu tu)
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah)
(Yeah)

(Ha ha ha ha ...)
(Ha ha ha ha ...)
(Ha ha ha ha ...)


8. One and One Make Five

Have you heard the news?
Everybody's asking who
Is that man you've been seen with
And why I never act with you

Please, tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
For people must be jumping
To the wrong conclusion
But one and one make five

What I need right now
Is to hear you say they got it wrong
That he's just a new friend
A perfectly innocent one

So, tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
For people must be jumping
To the wrong conclusion
But one and one make five
People are assuming
'Cause it's so confusing
But one and one make five

If one and one made two (made two)
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
Don't need to worry about you
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
If you hear gossip and rumor thrive
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
One and one add up to three, four or five
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)

One and one and one and one and one make five
(One and one make five)

Let's stay in tonight
Maybe disconnect the phone
The correct arithmetic
Just two of us at home

Oh, tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
(One and one make five)
For people must be jumping
To the wrong conclusion
But one and one make five
(One and one make five)

Tell me that you love me
Sort out this confusion
Say our love is still alive
(One and one make five)
For people must be jumping
To the wrong conclusion
But one and one make five
(One and one make five)

One and one make two (make two, make two)
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
Don't need to worry about you
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
I don't need to worry about you
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
Don't need to worry about you
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
One and one make two (make two)
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)
(Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go)


9. To Speak is a Sin

We've been around forever
Look at us now together
Ordering drinks at the bar

Saying hello to manfriends
Smiling across a friend's friends
Ordering drinks at the bar

To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare

(Ta da da da da aah Ta da da da da)

We'll stand around forever
Regardless of time or weather
Ordering drinks at the bar

Looking for love, and getting
Nothing that's worth regretting
But wondering why we travel so far

To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare

To speak is a sin
You'd better beware (aah)
But once in a while
A smile, if you dare (aah)

(Aah, Aah, Aah)

To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare

To speak is a sin
You'd better beware (aah)
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare (oooh)

(Aaah Aaah Oooh)

(Aaah)


10. Young Offender

You may be broke now, and you may be bored
Call you delinquent or leave you ignored
You'll get what you want

Drive to distraction, crash on the way
Watch your reaction, wait 'till you say
You'll get what you want
It hurts if you can't

Young offender, what's your defense?
You're younger than me, obviously
Young offender, why the pretense?
You don't agree, I know, I know

I'll do what you want if you want me enough
I'll put on my book and start falling in love
Or isn't that done?

How graceful your movement, how bitter your scorn
I've been a teenager since before you were born
And I'm younger than some
I've only begun

Young offender, what's your defense?
You're younger than me, obviously

Will I get in your way, or open your eyes?
Who will give whom the bigger surprise?

Is there fire in your eyes, or the glow of machines?
Watch how your fingers burn over the keys
So sure what you do
I haven't a clue

Young offender, what's your defense?
You're younger than me, obviously
Young offender, how you resent
The lovers you need, it hurts when they bleed
Young offender, why the pretense?
You don't agree, I know, I know


11. One in a Million

Why
This uncertainty?
It's not clear to me
Would you rather be independent?
Have I lost your love?
Have you had enough?
Do you feel too much resentment?
How can I make you see
When you disagree
That you just can't leave?

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

I
Won't stand in your way
I can make you stay
Though, of course, I feel rejected
You're a part of me
You're the family
I can't bear to leave

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

Feel
Free
To leave
If you think you're trapped, but
Please
Believe
I'll always want you back

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

(Go West)
(Do you feel it?)
(Do you feel it?)
(Go West)
(Do you feel it?)
(Do you feel it?)


*Postscript*

I believe in ecstasy
The times we've had, you and me

Friends we've met along the way
Partied every night and day

And I know we'll meet again
