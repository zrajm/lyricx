1. Alice

It's dreamy weather we're on
You wave your crooked wand
Along an icy pond
With a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows
I saw...
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond
Spell Alice

I'll disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere beneath the sea
There's the wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass
On the tide
And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby, all that I can think of
Is Alice

Arithmetic
Arithmetoc
I turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat
How did the razor find my throat
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier

And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and
I'm lost in your hair
But I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice
Of Alice
There's only Alice

[[ Tom Waits, Kathleen Brennan ]]


2. Everything You Can Think

Everything you can think of is true
Before the ocean was blue
We were lost in a flood
Run red with you bloods
Nigerian skeleton crew

Everything you can think of is true
The dish ran away with a spoon
Dig deep in your heart for that little red glow
We're decomposing as we go

Everything you can think of is true
And fishes make wishes on you
We're fighting our way up dreamland's spine
With black flamingos and terrible wine

Everything you can think of is true
The baby's asleep in your shoe
Your teeth are buildings with yellow doors
Your eyes are fish on a creamy shore

[[ Tom Waits, Kathleen Brennan ]]


3. Flowers Grave

Shall we die tonight
Shall we die tonight
We've always loved adventure
Shall we die tonight
Shall we die tonight
Shall we die tonight

Someday the silver moon and I
Will go to Dreamland
I will close my eyes
And wake up there in Dreamland
But tell me who will put flowers
On a flower's grave
Who will say a prayer

Will I meet a China rose there
In Dreamland
Or does love lie bleeding
In Dreamland
Are these days gone forever and always

If we are to die tonight
Is there moonlight up ahead
And if we are to die tonight
Another rose will bloom

For a faded rose
Will I be the one that you save
I love when it showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave

As one rose dies another blooms
It's always been that way
I remember the showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave


4. No One Knows I'm Gone

Hell above and heaven below
All the trees are gone
The rain has such a lovely sound
To those who are six feet under ground
The leaves will bury every year
And no one knows I'm gone

Live me golden tell me dark
Hide from Graveyard John
But the moon is full here every night
And I can bathe here in his light
The leaves will bury every year
And no one knows I'm gone

6. Poor Edward

Did you hear the news about Edward?

On the back of his head
He had another Face
Was it a womans's face
Or a young girl

They said to remove it would kill him
So poor Edward was doomed
The Face could laugh and cry
It was his Devil twin
And at night she spoke to him
Of things heard only in Hell
They are impossible to separate
Chained together for life.

Finally the bell tolled his doom
He took a suite of rooms
And hung himself and her
From the balcony irons
Some still believe he was freed from her
But I knew her to well
I say she drove him to suicide
And took Poor Edward to Hell


7. Table Top Joe

Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Everyone knows Tabletop Joe

Well, my Mama didn't want me
On the day I was born
Born without a body
I got nothin' but scorn

But I always loved music
All I had was my hands
And I dreamed I'd be famous
And I'd work at The Sands

Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Everyone knows Tabletop Joe

I had trouble with the pedals
But I had a strong left hand
And I could play Stravinsky
On a baby grand

I said I'm gonna join the circus
'cause that's where I belong
And I went to Coney Island
Singing this song

Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Everyone knows Tabletop Joe

And they gave me top billing
In the Dreamland show
I had my own orchestra
Starring Tabletop Joe

And the man without a body
Proved everyone wrong
I was rich and I was famous
And I was where I belonged
Singing

Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Now everyone knows
Tabletop Joe


8. Lost In The Harbour

Over here the ladies
All want perfume
But there's never a rose
And over there
The roses are frightened to bloom
So they never can grow

And over here they need wool
For weaving baby's new clothes
But nobody has any wool
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour
Lost in the harbour

And over here
They want diamonds to wear
But there aren't any here
And over there,
Everyone's hiding their tears
But they're crying inside

And the wall won't come down
Till they are no longer afraid of themselves
If you don't believe me, ask the elves
And I can come down
To the harbour
Down to the harbour

And then I will
Back up the ocean with my tears
I still have i couple more years
And then I can come back
To the harbour
Down to the harbour


9. We're All Mad Here

Hang me in a bottle like a cat
Let the crows pick me clean but for my hat
Where the wailing of a baby
Meets the footsteps of the dead
We're all mad here

As the Devil sticks his flag into the mud
Mrs. Carroll has run off with Father Judd
Hell is such a lonely place
And your big expensive face
Will never last

Have lave I told you all about the Eyeball Kid
He was born alone inside a Petri dish
And he was born without a body or a brow

And you'll die with the rose still on your lips
And in time the heart-shaped bone
That was your hips
And all the worms they will climb
The rugged ladder of your spine
We're all mad here

And my eyeballs roll this terrible terrain
We're all inside a decomposing train
And your eyes will die like fish
And the shore of your face will turn to bone.


10. Watch Her Disappear

Dear Alice, last night I dreamed that I was dreaming of you.
And from a window
across the lawn I watched you undress wearing a sunset of purple tightly woven
around your hair that rose in strangled ebony curls moving in a yellow bedroom
light.
The air is wet with sound.
The faraway yelping of a wounded dog.
The
ground drinking a slow faucet leak.
Your house is so soft and fading as it soaks
the black summer heat.
A light goes on and the door opens.
A yellow cat runs out
on the stream of hall light and into the yard.
A wooden cherry scent is faintly
breathing the air.
I hear your champagne laugh.
You wear two lavender orchids,
one in your hair and one on your hip.
A string of yellow carnival lights comes on
with the dusk, circling the lake with a slowly dipping halo and I heard a banjo
tango playing a minor waltz.
And you danced into the shadow of a black poplar
tree and I watched you as you disappeared.
I watched you as you disappeared.
I watched you as you disappeared.
I watched you as you disappeared.
I watched you as you disappeared.


11. Reeperbahn

Round the curve of the parrot bar
A broken-down old movie star
Hustling an Easterner
Bringing out the beast in her
A high dive on a swimming pool
Filled with needles and with fools
The memories are short but the tales are long
When you're in the Reeperbahn

Well, They called her Rosie when she was a girl
For her bright red cheeks and her strawberry curls
When she would laugh the river would run
She said she'd be a comedian.
Oh what a pity, oh what a shame
When she said come calling, nobody came
Now her bright red cheeks are painted on
And she's laughing her head off in the Reeperbahn

Now little Hans was always strange
Wearing women's underthings
His father beat him but he wouldn't change
He ran off with a man one day
Now his lingerie is all the rage
In the black on every page
His father proudly calls his name
Down there in the Reeperbahn

Now if you've lost your inheritance
And all you've left is common sense
And you're not to picky about the crowd you keep
Or the mattress where you sleep
Behind every window, behind every door
The apple is gone but there's always the core
The seeds will sprout up right through the floor
Down there in the Reeperbahn

Down there in the Reeperbahn

Down there in the Reeperbahn


12. I'm Still Here

You haven't looked at me that way in years
You dreamed me up and left me here
How long was I dreaming for
What was it you wanted me for
You haven't looked at me that way in years
Your watch has stopped and the pond is clear
Someone turn the lights back on
I'll love you till all time is gone
You haven't looked at me that way in years
But I'm still here


13. Fish & Bird

They bought a round for the sailor
And they heard his tale
Of a world that was so far away
And a song that we'd never heard
A song of a little bird
That fell in love with a whale

He said: You cannot live in the ocean
And she said to him:
You never can live in the sky
But the ocean is filled with tears
And the sea turns into a mirror
And there's a whale in the moon when it's clear
And a bird on the tide

Please don't cry
Let me dry
Your eyes

So tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend you're mine
Though I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart

Please don't cry
Let me dry
Your eyes

And tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend you're mine
Though I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart


14. Barcarolle

A cloud lets go of the moon
Her ribbons are all out of tune
She's skating on the ice in a glass
And in the hands of a man
That she kissed on the train
The children have all gone into town
To get candy and we are
Alone in the house here
And your eyes fall down on me

And I belong only to you
The water is filling my shoes
In the wine of my heart there's a stone
In a well made of bone
That you bring to the pond
And I'm here in your pocket
And curled up in a dollar
And the chain from your watch
Around my neck
And I'll stay right here till it's time

The girls all knit in the shade
Before the baby is made
And the branches bend down to the ground
Here to swing on
I'm lost in the blond summer grass
And the train whistle blows
And the carnival goes
Till there's only the tickets and crows here
And the grass will all grow back
The branches
Spell Alice
And I belong only to you
