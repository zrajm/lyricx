1. Until Death --Us Do Part--

Now you have me
Now I'm there
Now I have you
Now you care

Now I got you
Now you care
Now you have me and
Now I'm there

Now we're tied - Until death us do part
Now I'm making my way inside
Now I'm feeding myself with you
And the more I grow, the more you decline
Now we're tied until death us do part

F-O-R-E-V-E-R

Now it's time for you to be sure
That the life we share will be long
That what can't be cured has to be endured
Now we're tied until death us do part

2. Circling Overland

1-1-2029, the stars are shining bright

Nerves connected to the center, we are tied to the machine
Invisible and silent, circling overland
The planemakers designed us to outturn and outmaneuver
Intruders in the skies, intruders in our skies

1-1-2029, tonight the stars are shining bright

Backbone of the fighter force, of the defence industry,
Devoted tools of the power, warrants of the order

1-1-2029 tonight the stars are shining bright

Silicon advisers leading the way
We reach our cruising altitude
1-1-2029, West Europe, midnight
Invisible and silent, circling overland
Scanning, taping, filing, instantly checking
Every human, car and plane of the quarters we survey

CIRCLING OVERLAND

CIRCLING OVERLAND


3. Im Rhythmus Bleiben

Einatmen, ausatmen, einatmen, ausatmen
Im Rhythmus bleiben, im Rhythmus bleiben
Was soll ish tun?
Im Rhythmus bleiben, im Rhythmen bleiben

ALLES WAS DRIN IST

DUE / QUATRO / DUE

RAUS! RAUS!


4. Felines

They come to track down the sobbing
They come to sully the sorrow
To see the bloody insides
To eat their fill of dispair
They come to track down the sobbing
To pulverize the most intimate pains

Let's feed the felines
Bury your head in the sand or go round
in circles

Deeply caught in their conceit
They gather to check their luck
The vultures sweeping down upon the
street
To eat their fill of despair

Let's feed the felines...


5. First In / First Out

You like the body, move the body,
You like the body, move the body.

Full force, full force ahead

Don't stay aside - I mean to be obeyed
Don't switch off, switch on the power

You like the body, so move the body

I GO DOWN THERE EVERY
NIGHT...
JUST TO FEEL THE BEAT


7. Headhunter V3.0

FREEZE! SHOOT TO KILL OR DIE
Today he has no means, he's alone and anonymous
But written in his cells he has got the marks og the
genius
I'm looking for this man to sell him to other men
To sell him to other men at ten times the price at least
I'm looking for this man who knows the rules of the game
Who's able to forget them to realize my aim
I'm looking for this man to make us rich and famous

One - You lock the target
Two - You bait the line
Three- You slowly spread the net
And four - You catch the man


8. Work 01

IS THIS THE KIND OF WORK YOU'D LIKE TO DO?

Tonight I meet my friends
Together we celebrate...
THE BODY MUTILATED
ANOTHER MUTILATED BODY
WE HAVE AGREED TO TRY HYPNOSIS
HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETLY MAD?
I wake up freezing bleeding in the basement
O my head, I don't remember anything
I guess the night was exciting

LISTEN CAREFULLY!

When I'm clear I happen to regret
All the losses I will never retrieve
Hey you, hey me, carcass in the mirror
As hard as a rock and selfish to the core
WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
I've been waiting for the good times

I NOSTRI SOGNI SONO SEMPRE PRESENTI
ALL THE BODIES MUTILATED IN THE SAME
OBSCENE MANNER


9. Terminal State

What about the figures?
What about the facts?
What about the outbreaks?
What about ourselves?
What about the figures?
They don't stop climbing
What about the outbreak?
It keeps on spreading
See it gaining ground
Digging in the wound

We're in the doldrums

Quantizing is frightening
The facts are blinding
Time is dragging
The facts are blinding
We're a party in a suit
Now the worm is in the fruit
See it gaining ground
Digging in the wound

We're in the doldrums

You could make it just around the block
It's able to sneak in any lock
On your shoulder there, is it a pock?
Will the scales ever fall from your eyes?

What about the figures?
They don't stop climbing
What about the outbreak?
It keeps on spreading
Now the lines are converging
To the point of no return
See it gaining ground, amplifying the wound
A disaster (You name it!)
A disaster occurs
Under your very eyes
See it gaining ground
Digging in the wound

We're in the doldrums

THE DOLDRUMS...
THE OUTBREAK...
DISASTER... THE FACTS... THE LINES


10. Welcome to Paradize

Hey poor, you don't have to be poor anymore
Jesus is here!
In the name of Jesus (Alleluiah!)
Feel like your life is going nowhere
Ten seconds... Standby
Jesus is the Son of God
Come in Jesus (Alleluiah!)
Oh God I'm a sinner!
I deserve to go to hell (Alleluiah!)

NO SEX UNTIL MARRIAGE!

Oh God I'm a sinner, I deserve to go to hell
The bible said you keep him out in the lie
In the name of Jesus
Jesus is the Son of God
In the name of Jesus (Alleluiah!)
Hey poor, you don't have to be poor anymore
Jesus is here! (Don't tell the devil)
Hey poor, you don't have to be Jesus!
