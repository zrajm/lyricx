1. One More Chance

The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home
Tonight I've been walking in the rain
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame

Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
Just give me one more, one more chance
One more, one more chance

I will find out wherever you are
Drinking in another club or driving in your car
Walking through empty streets
Stupid fool, that was yours for keeps

Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight

The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home
Tonight I've been walking in the rain
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame

Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
Just give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight

You're so extreme
I want to take you home with me
Come on, tell me one more time
I don't mind, baby, I don't mind
I don't mind

Just give me one more ...

Push me in the corner and I'll scream ...

One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance
Just give me one more
One more
One more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance to-...

I don't mind ...


2. What Have I Done to Deserve This?

You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I've always worked for my living
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?

I come here looking for money
(Got to have it)
And end up living with love, oh, oh
Now you left me with nothing
(Can't take it)
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?

I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers
I read you books and talked for hours
Every day, so many drinks
Such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I ...

Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much, oh, oh
Now I can do what I want to - forever
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?

At night, the people come and go
They talk too fast, and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I ...

Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through? (tell me)
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through? (yeah)
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

Gonna get through?
Gonna get through?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
I'm gonna get through, right?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
You never ever left me, baby, think of me...
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Oh, babe
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?

Gonna get through, baby, I'm gonna get
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Forever
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Gonna get through, baby, yeah,
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Gonna get through, get through, baby, ooh
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?


3. Shopping

We're buying and selling your history
How we go about it is no mystery
We check it with the city, then change the law
Are you looking forward?
Now you want some more

We're S-H-O-PP-I-N-G, we're shopping

It's easy when you got all the information
Inside help, no investigation
(No investigation, investigation)
No questions in the house, no give and take
There's a big bang in the city
We're all on the make

We're S-H-O-PP-I-N-G, we're shopping
We're S-H-O-PP-I-N-G, we're shopping

Our gain is your loss, that's the price you pay
I heard it in the House of Commons: everything's for sale

We're shopping
We're shopping

We're S-H-O-PP-I-N-G, we're shopping
We're S-H-O-PP-I-N-G, we're shopping

We're S-H-O-PP-I-N-G, we're shopping

(We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shopping
We're shopping)


4. Rent

(Again... Again... Again... Ooooh
(Again... Again... Again... Again... ...)

You dress me up, I'm your puppet
You buy me things, I love it
You bring me food, I need it
You give me love, I feed it

And look at the two of us in sympathy
With everything we see
I never want anything, it's easy
You buy whatever I need

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams
The currency we've spent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent

You phone me in the evening on hearsay
And bought me caviar
You took me to a restaurant off Broadway
To tell me who you are

We never-ever argue, we never calculate
The currency we've spent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent

I'm your puppet
I love it

And look at the two of us in sympathy
And sometimes ecstasy
Words mean so little, and money less
When you're lying next to me

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams
The currency we've spent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) Ooh, I love you, you pay my rent

Look at my hopes, look at my dreams
The currency we've spent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, you pay my rent

Look at my hopes, look at my dreams
The currency we've spent
(Ooooh) I love you, oh, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, you pay my rent
(Ooooh) I love you, you pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy)
(Ooooh) You pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy)
(Ooooh) You pay my rent (It's easy, it's so easy)
(Ooooh) I love you (It's easy, it's so easy)
(It's easy, it's so easy)
(It's easy, it's so easy)
(It's easy, it's so easy)
(It's easy, it's so easy)
(It's easy, it's so easy)
(It's easy, it's so easy)


5. Hit Music

Hit music on the radio
Hit music on the radio

When you dance with me we dance forever
All night long to your favourite

Hit music on the radio
Hit music on the radio

When you dance with me we dance forever
All night long to the latest song
Live a lie, dance together
All night long to your favourite

Hit music
Hit music

I've been working hard all day
To pay the bills I have to pay
Don't have the strength to work all night
Or fight until it's almost light

Music on the radio
D-dance music at the disco

Live a lie dance together
All night long to your favourite song
Live and die, it's all that we know
I need a friend at the journey's end

Hit music, in stereo

It's all about love, and it's about forgetting
Choose a song when the night's too long
We all need love and we want protection
I need a friend at the journey's end
In Kensington, or Spanish Harlem
All night long to your desperate

Hit music on the radio
Music at the disco
Hit music on the radio
Hit music on the radio


6. It Couldn't Happen Here

Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed
In six inch heels, quoting magazines
Go all the way, you knew you could
So far, so good

Someone asked: Who do you think you are?
Who pays your bills? How come you came this far?
Shrugged him off, and locked the door
So good, this far

Now it almost seems impossible
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here

I don't expect to talk in terms of sense
Our dignity and injured innocence
It contradicts your battle-scars
Still healed, so far

Now it almost seems incredible
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone
I may be wrong, but I thought we said
It couldn't happen here

Now it almost seems impossible
We've found ourselves back where we started from
I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here

I may be wrong, I thought we said
It couldn't happen here


7. It's a Sin

(Twenty seconds and counting...
T minus fifteen seconds, guidance is okay)

[?]

When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Father, forgive me, I tried not to do it
Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

(Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis fratres, quia peccavi nimis cogitatione,
verbo, opere et omissione, mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa)
[trans. "I confess to almighty God,
and to you my brothers,
that I have sinned exceedingly
in thought, word, act and omission,
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault"]

(Zero!)


8. I Want to Wake Up

I heard what you said, and I can tell you it's true
I heard you've said that I am crazy about you
Turn in my sleep, the bad dream is over
Think of you and shall I ever recover?

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up

I stood at the kitchen-sink, my radio played
Songs like "Tainted Love" and "Love Is Strange"
As I listened and the words hit my ears
I cried sudden tears

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Wake up
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)

(It's mad, it's mad, it's mad)
It's mad, to be in love with someone else
When you're in love with him, she's in love with me
But you know as well as I do
I can never think of anyone but you

(All my life,
all my life
I want to wake up)

Play with fire, play with guns
It's easy to impress someone
Turning in my sleep, you call me a fool
To fall in love, is it so uncool?

Now, I want to wake up
How I want to wake up
Now, I want to wake up
Wake up

(Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Wake up, wake up - Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)

I, I want to wake up
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
I, I want to wake up
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
I, I want to wake up
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
I, I want to wake up, with you, oh
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh - Oooh)
I, I want to wake up, with you, oh, ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh) I want to wake up, wake up, wake up
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
I, I want to wake up, wake up, wake up with you
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh) I want to wake up, ooh, ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh, Ooh ooh ooh oh oh)
Ooh


9. Heart

(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)

Every time I see you something happens to me
Like a chain reaction between you and me
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

If I didn't love you, I would look around for someone else
But every time I see you, you have the same effect
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Every time

I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you

(Beat)
(Beat)
(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)

(Beat)
(Beat)
(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)

Every time I see you, no matter what we do
There's a strange reaction, can you feel it too?
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time

I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you; I mean what I say
I'm in love with you, and you don't know
What it means to be with you

Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
Oh oh oh, every time
(Beat)
(Beat) Every time
(Beat)
(Beat) Every time
(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)

(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)
(Beat)
(H-H-Heartbeat)

10. King's Cross

The man at the back of the queue was sent
To feel the smack of firm government
Linger by the flyposter, for a fight
It's the same story every night
I've been hurt and we've been had
You leave home, and you don't go back

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way
Read it in a book or write it in a letter
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee

Only last night I found myself lost
By the station called King's Cross
Dead and wounded on either side
You know it's only a matter of time
I've been good and I've been bad
I've been guilty of hanging around

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way
Read it in a book or write it in a letter
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee

So I went looking out today
For the one who got away
Murder walking round the block
Ending up in King's Cross
Good luck, bad luck waiting in a line
It takes more than the matter of time

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way
Read it in a book or write it in a letter
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee

Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way
Read it in a book or write it in a letter
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee
And there's still no guarantee
There is still no guarantee
