1. Crapage

Always ready for another go
Always going for another round
Volunteering for a better try
And preparing for a clever side

You, you are kinder than the kind
You, you are milder than the mild

Chorus (2x)
Still, I believe you're gonna hold them tight
I can see you're trying to crush them now
I can feel you're gonna win

Always ready for another start
Always going for another round
You, you are perfect all the time
You, you must please the public line
You, you are kinder than the kind
You, you are milder than the mild
You, you are clean in every way

Chorus (2x)

What is there to strike for?
What is there to stand for?
What is there to drive you?
What is there to run for?
What is there to rise for?
What is there to shout for?
What is there to combat?
What is there to push back?

You, you are kinder than the kind
You, you are milder than the mild

Chorus (1x)


2. Waste

It's a wild dream
It's a withe scream
A devious dream
Just a flame in the fire

Can hear the drums of fate
Reverberate
From the very depths of the earth
Dream
This sacrifice
Red onto white

World wasn't remembered
World in my world
This hasn't been remembered

It's a wild dream...
Just a wild dream...

The trumps of fate
Are blown away
From the very heart of the world
Wild dream

World wasn't remembered
World in any world
This hasn't been remembered

No, no, no, no!
It's a wild dream...
It's a wild...


3. Skin

Stretch-sweat-pierce-lash
Chocke-crush-strange desire to fly
Scream-fight not to scream...

Let's keep on working, man!...

Shadows in the heat
Weaving on the ground
Sparkle in the sun
Boil in the dark
Start to vaporize
Here comes that need to fly... to fly!

Keep on working, man!... keep on working, man!...

Muscles in the dust
Figures in the light
Chocking in the haze
Lashing at the heart

Hurt (desire to)
Fire (desire to)
Shout (desire to)
Burst (desire to)
Fly!

Keep on working, man!

Hate time-hard time-crush time-strong time
Scream-fight no to scream...

Let's keep on working, man!... (5x)


4. Motion

The feel of the action
Is far behind
The fruit of the action
Gas nailed you down... dragged you down...
-Progress (3x)-
Sealing up reaction
Overwhelms your conscience
Leads to more diversion
And pulls you down
Coming to attention
Going through the tension
Praying for the sanction
You're reading out

Chorus
The feel of the action
The seed of the action
Will drag you down

Twenty fallen angels
Heading for salvation
Heading for the sanction
Will soil the sky
Gain a new dimension
Take a new direction
Whirlwind of emotion
For now's the time
-Progress, process, protest, no rest (8x) + integration of
"Feel..."

Chorus

The feel of the action...
Has nailed you down... dragged you down...
Nailed you down...
Nailed you down...
-Progress (16x)-
Twenty fallen angels
Heading for salvation
Heading for the sanction
Have reached the sun
Coming to attention
Going through the tension
Praying for the sanction
You're fading out
-I know this addiction
It's all in the passion-

Chorus
The seed of the action
The feel of the action
Has nailed you down...


5. Religion

'Right' branded on my brow
'Wrong' graven on my mind
You see, the sin is in me

When will it stop unfolding
When will I ever be face to face
With the devil in me

Chorus

Let me burn you... let me burn you...
Let me burn you down...
Let me burn you... let me burn you...
Let me burn you down...
Burn you down...

(Let me... let me...)

Brains wants to rule the heart
Heart wants to tie the hands
Unseat the assassin in me

So you cry, not to give it away
So you lie...

Chorus (2x)

Born with a wicked charm
Torn by this driving harm
You see, it moves into me

So you lie, not to give it away
So you cry

Chorus (2x)


6. Stratoscape

There's no returning (2x)
There is no action, no way to divide
Silence is growing (2x)
Out of refraction and way out of sight
No clear recalling, no, no clear recalling
There's no reaction, no way back to light

Chorus
Turn round and over, over and over
Turn round and over
My liquid time...
My liquid time...
Back to the place where you are...
A new void...

No more returning (2x)
Feeling no others but we may be blind
So long a waiting, so long a watching
There must be something moving there in the dark
No fear inside you, no, no fear inside you, no,
There's no reaction, no way back to light

Chorus

There's no returning, see, there's no returning
There is no action, no way to divide
Something's approaching, something's approaching
Ready to strike with every beat of your heart

Chorus


7. Hymn

One of us is waiting, one side of us waiting
Some of us are striving, somewhere on a mountain

One part of us keeps giving away, giving away, giving away...

Chorus

And disorder must come
And disorder must reign
Every minute will count
When disorder is king

One of us is waiting, one more number's waiting
Where's your revolution plan?
Where's your need to make a stand
To finalize, to synchronize?

One stand, one stand together
One stand, one stand to hang the standard high
The standard high
Where's your revolution plan?
Where's your need to understand
To find more time, to find more time?

Chorus

One of us is waiting, one side of us is waiting
Where's your revolution plan?
Where's the leading upperhand
To guide your life, to guide your life
One stand, one stand together
One stand, one stand to hang the standard high
The standard high

Chorus


8. Fuel

Standing on the surface
Taking on the malice
Aiming at the fracture

Moving on the surface
Looking for an access
-It's revolving-
Go away!... Go away!.... Go away!.... Go away!...

Chorus
What do you want from me today?
Going through the tunnel of another drain
What is your purpose anyway?
Going through the tunnel of another strain

Spiral on the surface
Bouncing on a lead space
-It's gyrating-
Heading for destruction
Coming up the surface
Taking on the menace
-It's revolving-
Heading for destruction-more destruction-to destruction
Feel the power!

Chorus

Standing on the surface
Taking on the malice
Moving on the surface
Looking for an access
Feel the power!

Chorus


8. Melt

Here: every eye is a mirror
Here: every act is a crime
Here: every presence a poison
Here: every wall is a spy

When you say 'turn', they all to turn
When you say 'dive', they're all on their knees

Chorus
Pretending to guide me, you led me astray
I don't want to fall into your kind of ways
I will never sway
And see thing that way

Here: every move is an error
Here: every breath is a fact
Turn! Start! Turn! Dive!
Here: every ear is a danger
Here: every smile is a trap
Here...

Pretending to guide me, you led me astray
I don't want to fall into your kind of ways

Break
I know you'll never take me
Don't even think you'll break me
Be sure you'll never take me
I'm gonna make you see!
Here: every look is a murder
Here: every word is a bite
When you say 'turn', they all start to turn
When you say 'dive', they're all on their knees
Turn! Start! Turn! Dive!

Chorus


10. Flag

Competion
All in one wave
None on their side
Or in-beetween

Unite
Has always been on your mind
No long-forgotten quest
No accidental thirst

Combination
All in one team
Starting no war
Or fantasy

Allied
To make this glorious cause
A fatal burst of rage
A pure and ruthless force

Unite has always been on your mind


11. Mutilate

We will stagger
We will stagger
On and on
A simple habit
Jump from one foot
To the other
On and on

Chained to the laws (2x)

Let's go further
Used to reeling
On and on
A plain reflex
If mistaken
Never lose faith
Steering on

We will stagger
Lose out bearings
On and on
Yes, there can be no
Obvious answers
As we move on, and on and on,
We must tremble
Lame and humble
On and on

Behind the stars
Beneath the walls
Below the ground
Before the storm...
Below the ground
Before the storm...

Chained to the laws (2x)

Useless anger
There's no answer
To be found
We will stagger
We will falter
Stained and blackened
On and on

Chained to the laws...
Chained to the laws...
You'd better know the laws...
