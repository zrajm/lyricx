1. Learning to Fly

[Written by Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music/EMI April Music Inc. ASCAP.]

Well I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down, as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Well the good ol' days, may not return
And the rocks might melt & the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Well some say life will beat you down, break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out, for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

I'm learning to fly, around the clouds,
But what goes up must come down

I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing


2. Kings Highway 

[Written by Tom Petty.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music ASCAP.]

When the time gets right
I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far away
From trouble my love

Under a big ol' sky
Out in a field of green
There's gotta be something
Left for us to believe

Oh, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway

No you can't hide out
In a six gun town
We wanna hold our heads up,
But we gotta stay down

I don't wanna end up
In a room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone
That I don't even know

Lover, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway


3. Into the Great Wide Open

[Written by Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.]

Eddie waited til' he finished high school
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
He met a girl out there with a tattoo too
The future was wide open

They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a night club he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue

The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the chart
The sky was the limit

His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said "I don't hear a single"
The future was wide open

Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue


4. Two Gunslingers 

[Written by Tom Petty.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music ASCAP.]

Two gungslingers walked out in the street and one said
"I don't wanna fight no more"
And the other gunslinger thought about it and said "Yeah,
What are we fighting for?

I'm takin' control of my life, I'm takin' control of my life,
I'm takin' control of my life now, right now, oh yeah"

Well the crowd that assembled for the gun fight
Were let down, everyone hissed and booed
And a stranger told his mrs. "that's the last one of these gunfights
You're ever gonna drag me to

I'm takin' control of my life, I'm takin' control of my life,
I'm takin' control of my life now, right now, oh yeah"

Well the two gunslingers, went ridin' out of town and
Were never heard from no more
And there ain't been a gunfight for a long time,
Maybe never, but nobody knows for sure

I'm takin' control of my life, I'm takin' control of my life,
I'm takin' control of my life now, right now,
Oh yeah


5. The Dark of the Sun

[Written by Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music/EMI April Music Inc. ASCAP.]

In the dark of the sun, will you save me a place?
Give me hope, give me comfort, get me to
A better place?

I saw you sail across a river
Underneath Orion's sword
In your eyes there was a freedom
I had never known before

Hey, yeah, yeah, in the dark of the sun
We will stand together
Yeah we will stand as one, in the dark of the sun

Past my days of great confusion
Past my days of wondering why
Will I sail into the heavens
Constellations in my eyes?

Hey, yeah, yeah, in the dark of the sun
We will stand together
Yeah we will stand as one, in the dark of the sun


6. All or Nothin' 

[Written by Tom Petty, Mike Campbell and Jeff Lynne.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music/Wild Gator Music/EMI April Music Inc. ASCAP.]

Your daddy was a Sgt. Major
You didn't wanna, but he made you
Wipe his brass from time to time 
If left a picture in your mind
You know? You know?

You want it all, you want it all,
All or nothin'

Here am I a fallen arrow
My load is wide, my street is narrow
My skin is thicker, my heart is tougher
I don't mind workin', but I'm scared to suffer
You know? You know?

You want it all, you want it all,
All or nothin'

Sweet chariots of L.A. swing low
At twilight time the smog makes a rainbow
So keep one eye on the weather
You had it good, you wanted better
You know? You know?

You want it all, you want it all,
All or nothin'


7. All the Wrong Reasons

Trouble blew in on a cold dark wind
It came without no warning
And that big ol' house went up for sale
They were on the road by morning
Oh, the days went slow, into the changing season
Oh, out in the cold, for all the wrong reasons

Well she grew up hard and she grew up fast
In the age of television
And she made a vow to have it all
It became her new religion
Oh, down in her soul, it was an act of treason
Oh, down they go for all the wrong reasons

Where the sky begins the horizon ends
Despite the best intentions
And a big ol' man goes up for sale
He becomes his own invention
Oh, the days go slow into the changing season
Oh, bought and sold, for all the wrong reasons
Oh, down they go for all the wrong reasons


8. Too Good to be True

[Written by Tom Petty.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music ASCAP.]

Her imagination ran wild
Could this really happen to me?
She could barely hold back the tears

It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true

Everything that she'd waited for
Everything that she'd dared to dream
Suddenly was outside her door

It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true
It was too good to be true

There was no talk of giving in
And just as hope was wearing thin
Her eyes were like a child again

Too good to be true

Morning on the outskirts of town
Sitting in the traffic alone
You don't know what it means to be free

It was too good to be true


9. Out in the Cold

[Written by Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music/EMI April Music Inc. ASCAP.]

The day fell down, the air fell cold
I walked out in the street
Daydreamed for a mile or two
Staring at my feet like a working boy
Out of luck, falling through the cracks
Night rolled in, I turned back home
A hard wind at my back

I'm out in the cold, body and soul
There's nowhere to go
I'm out in the cold

When I woke up my brain was stunned
I could not come around
I reached out to grab my keys
And tumbled to the ground
I thought of you starry-eyed, I wonder where we stand?
Did I just fall from your arms
Down into your hands?

I'm out in the cold, body and soul
There's nowhere to go
I'm out in the cold

I'm out standing in a door-way
I'm out walking 'round hands in my pockets
I'm out in the cold


10. You and I Will Meet Again

[Written by Tom Petty.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music ASCAP.]

You and I will meet again
When we're least expecting it
One day in some far off place
I will recognize your face
I won't say good-bye my friend
For you and I will meet again

I heard you singing to no one
I saw you dancing all alone
One day you belonged to me
Next day I just wouldn't know
Someday all the rules will bend
And you and I will meet again

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling so strong
Maybe someday our paths will cross

A red-winged hawk is circling
The blacktop stretches out for days
How could I get so close to you
And still feel so far away?
I hear a voice come on the wind
Sayin' you and I will meet again
I don't know how, I don't know when
But you and I will meet again


11. Makin' Some Noise

[Written by Tom Petty, Mike Campbell and Jeff Lynne.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music/ Wild Gator Music/EMI April Music Inc. ASCAP.]

When I was a young boy
I was workin' for the state
I wasn't makin' much money
I was stayin' out late
Go down at nighttime and 
Play music in the bars
Take my breaks out underneath the stars

I was makin' some noise
I was a workin' boy up at the top of my voice
Sayin' "Look at me mama I'm makin' some noise"

I had to rock the boat, I had to shake the tree
To see what'd fall down on me
I thought "Maybe I can make it if I never give in
I been down before, I ain't goin' down again"

I'm makin' some noise
I been a worried boy up at the top of my voice
Sayin' "Look at me mama I'm makin' some noise"

From across the canyon a guitar plays
Through an amplifier on a long delay
It was an old melody I recognized the song
I had an amplifier too, so I played along

I'm makin' some noise, I'm still a working boy
Up at the top of my voice
Sayin' "Look at me mama I'm makin' some noise"

I'm makin' some noise, I been a long gone boy


12. Built to Last

[Written by Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne.]
[©1991 Gone Gator Music/EMI April Music Inc. ASCAP.]

Somewhere out my doorway
Somewhere down my block
I can hear her heartbeat 
In rhythm with my clock
I want her more than diamonds
I want her more than gold
I want her more than anything anyone could hold

We were built to last
On until forever
The world is changing fast,
But our love was built to last

She has followed me down
Along some empty streets
She has followed me where the rain would fall in sheets
And I know I been changing
Changing like the wind
I was feeling burned out
I got tired of it

We were built to last
On until forever
The world is changing fast,
But our love was built to last

So come to me my darlin'
Hold me while I sleep
I know you feel lost,
But you're not in too deep

We were built to last,
On until forever
The world is changing fast,
But our love was built to last
