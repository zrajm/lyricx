1. Penitent

Once I stood alone so proud,
held myself above the crowd
and now I am low on the ground.

From here I look around to see
what avenues belong to me,
I can't tell what I've found.

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you -Â Please?
I wait to hear.

The mother; and the matador;
the mystic; each were here before,
like me, to stare you down.

You appear without a face,
disappear; but leave your trace,
I feel your unseen frown.

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you, please?
I wait to hear:
Your voice,
the word
you say.
I wait:
to see your sign.
Would I
obey?

I look for you in heathered moor;
the desert, and the ocean floor,
how low does one heart go.

Looking for your fingerprints
I find them in coincidence,
and make my faith to grow.

Forgive me all my blindnesses,
my weakness and unkindnesses
as yet unbending still.

Struggling so hard to see,
my fist against eternity
and will you break my will?

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you, please?
I wait to hear:
Your voice,
the word
you say.
I wait:
to see your sign.
Would I
obey?

Now what would you have me do?
I ask you, please?
I wait to hear:
Your voice,
the word
you say.
I wait:
to see your sign.
Could I
obey?


2. Widow's Walk

Consider me a widow, boys
And I will tell you why
It's not the man, but it's the marriage
That was drowned

So I walk the walk
And wait with a watchful eye out to the sky
Looking for a kind of vessel
I have never found

Though I saw it splinter
I keep looking out to sea
Like a dog with little sense
I keep returning

To the very area where
I did see the thing go down
As if there's something at the site
I should be learning

That line is the horizon
We watch the wind and set the sail
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail

If I tell the truth
Then I will have to tell you this
Though I grieve (and I believe
I feel it truly)

But I knew that ship was empty
By the time it hit the rocks
'Cause we could not hold on
When fate became unruly

So consider me a widow, boys
And I have told you why
Does the weather say
A better day is nearing?

I'll set my house in order now
And wait upon the Will
But it's clear that I need
Better skill in steering

That line is the horizon
We watch the wind and set the sail
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail

That line is the horizon
We watch the wind and set the sail
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail

Point to fail


3. (I'll Never Be) Your Maggie May

I'll never be your Maggie May,
the one you loved and left behind
the face you see in light of day
and then you cast away,
that isn't me in that bed you'll find.

I'd rather take myself away,
be like those ladies in Japan.
I rather paint myself a face
conjure up some grace
or be the eyes behind a fan.

And so you go;
no girl could say no
to you..

Oh, there's the way I may appear
but that will change from day to night.
Would you ever see within?
Underneath the skin?
Could I believe you had that sight?

And so you go;
no girl could say no
to you..

I'll never be your Maggie May,
the one you loved and then forgot.
I'll love you first and let you go
'cause it must be so
and you'll fogive or you will not.

And so a woman leaves a man.
And so a world turns on its end,
so I'll see your face in dreams
Nothing's what it seems;
still you appear some kind of friend.

And so you go;
no girl could say no
to you..


4. It Makes Me Wonder

Virgin Mary on a chain
has hit me in the mouth again
as we explore the carnal score
of sacred and profane.

Sulky boy won't drink his milk
so mothers breast beneath the silk
remain untouched it's way too much
reject all of that ilk.

I have to say; it makes me wonder
if you are holding me
to the same blue flame that you are under
'cause I feel you scolding me.
makes me wonder
makes me wonder

Your virgin Mary's in the way
hallucinate her face by day
obscure the view in front of you
it's me here made of clay

you're playing near that line so thin,
austerity? or just give in
to endless appetite.
embrace that white oblivion?

I have to say; it makes me wonder
if you are holding me
to the same blue flame that you are under
when you are holding me
when you are holding me

and why so high the expectation?
whou could live up to this?
and there is no time now for explanation
cool as an angel's kiss

And I have to say; it makes me wonder
if you were holding me
if you were holding me
to that cold blue flame that you are under
when you were holding me
when you were holding me

it makes me wonder
have to say
it makes me wonder
have to say
it makes me wonder
have to say


5. Soap and Water

Soap and water;
Take the day from my hand,
scrub the salt from my stinging skin,
slip me loose of this wedding band.

Soap and water;
Hang my heart on the line,
scour it down in a wind of sand,
bleach it clean to a vinegar shine.

Daddy's a dark riddle,
mama's a headful of bees,
you are my little kite;
carried away in the wayward breeze.

Soap and water;
wash the year from my life,
straighten all that we trampled and tore,
heal the cut we call husband and wife.

Daddy's a dark riddle,
mama's a handful of thorns,
you are my little kite;
caught up again in the household storms.

Daddy's a dark riddle,
mama's a headful of bees,
you are my little kite;
carried away in the wayward breeze.


6. Songs in Red and Gray

The reproach on your daughter's most beautiful face
Made me wonder just how she could know
Of that something that happened
Beteen you and me
So much more than a long time ago

Her mother, I can see, lives within her still
Cause she looked at me with her eyes
Though I had only just met her right then
I feel that she peeled back my guilty disguise

Did I break the thread, or did you break the thread?
Well, at this point, we could ask; who cares?
As for the promises broken and frayed
Well, it's nineteen years late for repairs

The gray pewter vase held the deep red rose
One piece of coral shone white
By the brass candlestick, near your red velvet coat
Is everything I can recall of one night

Will you please tell me why I remember these things
After all of this time, I don't know
I must have left all those feeling inside
'Cause that year I had no courage to show

Was I the name you could never pronounce?
Did I even figure at all?
All of this happened before she was born
Did I shadow her young pencil marks on the wall?

Still I am sure I was only but one
Of a number who darkened that door
Of your home, and your hearth, and your family and wife
Who'd been darkened so often before

And the red leaf looks to the hard gray stone
To each other; they know what they mean
Somewhere their future is still yet to come
In ways that are, yet as of now, unforeseen


7. Last Year's Troubles

Last year's troubles
Last year's troubles

Last year's troubles are so old fashioned
The robber on the highway, the pirate on the seas
Maybe it's the cloting that's so entertaining
The earrings and swashbuckling blouses that please.

Here we have heroes of times that have passed now
But nobody these days has that kind of chin
Over there, the petticoats of ladies of virtue
You can hardly tell them from the petticoats of sin

Last year's troubles
Last year's troubles

Look at all the waifs of Dickensian England
Why is it, their suffering is more picturesque?
Must be cause their rags are so very Victorian
The ones here at home just don't, give it their best

Last years troubles; they shine up so prettily
They gleam with a luster they don't have today
Here it's just dirty and violent and troubling, etc.

Last year's troubles
Last year's troubles

But trouble is still trouble, and evil's still evil
Sometimes we wonder; is there more now, or less?
If we had a tool or could tally the handfuls
Measure for measure, it's the same would be my guess

Last year's troubles
Last year's troubles

Last year's troubles
Last year's troubles


8. Priscilla

She'd come to my house
and dance in the hall
with the music up loud,
against the light on the wall.

And I danced beside her,
feeling no shame,
we were in costume
and this was a game.

She'd put on her skirt,
layers of chiffon,
the top of the ubrella had come off;
so I put that on.

We'd dance together,
an awkward ballet.
She's 20 years older that I was,
but still we did play.

She was 20 years older than me
and many times my size.
It's her little feet I remember,
the look in her eyes.

Once when I saw her
she made me a doll
of ribbon and paper and ink
and lace, I recall.

I danced beside her,
feeling no shame,
'cause we were in costume,
this was a game.

I think of her now that I'm older.
I still love to dance.
Something will shine through the body
if you give it a chance.


9. If I Were a Weapon

Ooh

If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range, I guess
With silencer and stun

I feel more like a needle
Always pulling on the thread
Always making the same point again
And wondering if you heard what I just said

If you were a weapon
A hammer's what you'd be
Blunt and heavy at the end
And coming down on me

I've concealed a weapon
Like a pocket knife attack
All folded up inside, until you see the shine
And then you'll want it back

Ooh

I've concealed a weapon
Like a pocket knife attack
All folded up inside, until you see the shine
And then you'll want it back

Ooh

If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range, I guess
With silencer and stun

If I am that weapon
I pointing now at you
So just put down the hostage and we'll
Talk it down until we see this through

Ooh

Talk it down until we see this through

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh


10. Harbor Song

I dreamed you were a rich man
and that I had no place to go.
I came to you to see if you would take me in,
through golden curtains you told me 
you'd let me know.

Well, you drink for ten, and you smoke for twenty,
and your fickle heart will never be true
but still I feel the wind in from the harbor.
That's when I know the longing for you.
That's when I know the old longing for you.

I saw you, in my mind's eye,
you were laid out, your final day.
I stood in line to see that handsome face once more.
It had been so dear to me, I kissed you as you lay.
You were so dear to me, I kissed you as you lay.

Now whenever I do travel,
if to England, Portugal, or Spain,
as I do walk by the shipyards and the harbors,
I smell the salt, and the bay rum of your ghost again
I know the salt and the bay rum, you beside me again.


11. Machine Ballerina

Am I an afternoon's pastime?
A thing on a string
to be thrown an retrieved?
Like a phone call recieved
on somebody's birthday,
to tease and delight,
and then goodnight,
and the just say goodbye?

Am I toy on a tray?
A soft piece of clay?
Queen or clown for the day?
machine ballerina,
soldier of tin,
Standing so loyal
while you sit so royal
Then I'm put away?

For your approval,
perusal,
and your possible
refusal,
I'm amusing,
I'm a puppet for your play.

Am I your Mad Magazine?
Skin trampoline?
Pin-up pinball machine?
Your fantasy girl
of puzzling parts?
But non fits or starts.
We match wits but not hearts,
I'm heard but never seen?

For your approval,
perusal,
and your possible
refusal,
I'm amusing,
I'm a puppet for your play.


12. Solitaire

Black on red, and red on black.
It's a tic of a tired mind.
Come and sit down, won't you
try your luck.
See if you unwind.

Never use your threes and twos.
Follow superstition
otherwise you are going to lose.
Compulsion makes you listen.

Take what's wrong, and make it go right.
You can weave it like a prayer.
Wonder if you'll spend the night
playing solitaire.

Just do it again, when you find you're all done,
like an idiot savant.
Shuffle up your luck.
You see, you almost won, now.
Wrestle down what you want.

Jack on the Queen, and the ten on the Jack,
it's a happy repetition;
you and your fate in a kind of check-mate.
You're your only competition.

Take what's wrong, and make it go right.
You can weave it like a prayer.
Are you going to spend the night?
Playing solitaire?

Take what's wrong, and make it go right.
You can weave it like a prayer.
Are you going to spend the night?
Playing solitaire?


13. St. Clare

Call on that saint
and the candle that burns.
Keeping her safe
until her return.

Plaster and paint,
holding the fire.
A poor woman's saint,
holding all man's desire.

Bold little bird;
fly away home.
Could I but ride herd,
on the wind and the foam.

All of the souls,
that curl by the fire,
they never know
all man's desire.

Watercress clings
to the banks of the stream,
in the first grip of spring,
when snow melts to green.

Barefoot and cold
and holding a lyre,
by the side of the road,
holding all man's desire.

Call on the saint
when the white candle burns,
Keeping her safe
until her return.
