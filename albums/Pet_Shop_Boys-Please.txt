1. Two Divided by Zero

(Two divided by zero, zero)
(Two divided by zero, zero, zero)

Let's not go home, we'll catch the late train
I've got enough money to pay all the way
When the postman calls, he'll deliver the letter
I've explained everything; it's better that way

(Divided by, divided by) I think they heard a rumour
(Divided by, divided by) Or someone tipped them off
(Divided by, divided by) It's better to go sooner
(Divided by, divided by) Than call it all off

We'll catch a plane to New York, and a cab going down
Cross the bridges and tunnels, straight into town
Tomorrow morning we'll be miles away
On another continent and another day

(Divided by, divided by) Let's not go home
(Divided by, divided by) Or call it a day
(Divided by, divided by) You won't be alone
(Divided by, divided by) Let's run away

(Two divided by zero, zero)
(Two divided by zero, zero, zero)
(D...d...d...d...d...divided by)
(Divided by, divided by)
(Z...z...z...z...z...zero, zero]
(Divided by)

(Divided by, divided by) Someone spread a rumour
(Divided by, divided by zero, zero) 
(Divided by, divided by) Better to go sooner
(Divided by, divided by) Let's run away

So why hang around for the deed to be done
You can give it all up for a place in the sun
When the postman calls we'll be miles away
On a plane to New York and another day

(Divided by, divided by) I think they heard a rumour
(Divided by, divided by) Or someone tipped them off
(Divided by, divided by) It's better to go sooner
(Divided by, divided by) Than call it all off

(Divided by, divided by) Someone spread a rumour
(Divided by, divided by) And someone has to pay
(Divided by, divided by) Let's not go home
(Divided by, divided by) Let's run away
(Divided by, divided by) Let's not go home
(Divided by, divided by) Let's run away


2. West End Girls

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Oooh West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End Girls
West End girls

You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'till I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
>From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world
East End Boys, West End girls
West End girls

West End girls

West End girls
(How far have you been?)

Girls
East End boys
And West End girls
And West End girls
And West End girls

East End boys
The West End girls
The West End boys
And West End girls

The West End girls
The West End boys
The West End girls


3. Opportunities (Let's Make Lot Of Money)

I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
Let's make lots of -

I've had enough of scheming and messing around with jerks
My car is parked outside, I'm afraid it doesn't work
I'm looking for a partner, someone who gets things fixed
Ask yourself this question: Do you want to be rich?

I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains
Let's make lots of money

You can tell I'm educated, I studied at the Sorbonne
Doctored in mathematics, I could have been a don
I can program a computer, choose the perfect time
If you've got the inclination, I have got the crime

Oh, there's a lot of opportunities
If you know when to take them, you know?
There's a lot of opportunities
If there aren't, you can make them
Make or break them

I've got the brains, you've got the looks
Let's make lots of money
Let's make lots of -
(Aahhhhh) Money
(Aahhhhh)
(Aahhhhh - Di du da di da bu di ba)

You can see I'm single-minded, I know what I could be
How'd you feel about it, come and take a walk with me?
I'm looking for a partner, regardless of expense
Think about it seriously, you know, it makes sense

Let's (Got the brains)
Make (Got the looks)
Let's make lots of money (Oohh money)
(Let's) You've got the brawn
(Make) I've got the brains
Let's make lots of money (Oohh money)

I've got the brains (Got the brains)
You've got the looks (Got the looks)
Let's make lots of money (Oohh money)
Money


4. Love Comes Quickly

Sooner or later, this happens to everyone
To everyone

You can live your life lonely
Heavy as stone
Live your life learning 
And working alone
Say this is all you want
But I don't believe that it's true
'Cause when you least expect it
Waiting round the corner for you

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

You can live a life of luxury
If that's what you want
Taste forbidden pleasures
Whatever you want

You can fly away to the end of the end of the world
But where does it get you to?
'Cause just when you least expect it
Just what you least expect

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

I know it sounds ridiculous, but speaking from experience
It may seem romantic, and that's no defense
Love will always get to you

Sooner or later, sooner or later, this happens to everyone
To everyone

You can fly away to the end of the end of the world
But where does it get you?

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
(Oooh)

Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)
Love comes quickly, whatever you do
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)


5. Suburbia

Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
Roaming suburban boys
Mother's got a hairdo to be done
She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
In this suburban hell
And in the distance a police car
To break the suburban spell

Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia

Break the window by the town hall
Listen, the siren screams
There in the distance, like a roll call
Of all the suburban dreams

Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia

I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around

It's on the front page of the papers
This is their hour of need
Where's a policeman when you need one
To blame the colour TV?

Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia
In Suburbia
In Suburbia

Take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia

Run with the dogs tonight
In Suburbia
You can't hide
In Suburbia
In Suburbia
In Suburbia
In Suburbia
In Suburbia


6. Opportunities (Reprise)


7. Tonight Is Forever

I may be wrong, I may be right
The money's short and time is tight
Don't even think about those bills
Don't pay the price, we never will
We're out again another night
I never have enough
It will be like this forever
If we fall in love

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key

I may be wrong, I may be right
So don't depend, I could lie
I haven't got a job to pay
But I could stay in bed all day
Then out again another night
I never have enough
It will be like this forever
If we fall in love

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight is the first night

We don't need any more when we dance
I don't think of the future tonight

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key

I may be wrong, I may be right
But I don't give up any night
You could say conventional
And I could claim intentional
We're out again another night
We never have enough
It will be like this forever
When we fall in love

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key

Tonight


8. Violence

The sons and brothers, fighting for another cause
Anything to give their lives some meaning
Busy with their guns and dreaming
Far away from here
Said they would act in self-defense

And all the others, running 'round so hot and bothered
Anything to give their lives some meaning
In the evening
Running around with guns and
Said they would act in self-defense
With violence

Violence
Violence
Violence breeds
Violence
Violence breeds

The son and brother, when he gets home
He gives someone some love
And mutters: "Woman, you'll never understand
I did what I said in self-defense
With violence"

Violence breeds
Violence
Violence breeds
Violence
Violence breeds
Violence


9. I Want A Lover

At this time of night, when the crowds have passed
We're the last to leave, we need some company
No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why
You know the reason that we need this company
I've been sitting here, looking out for you
Someone just like me, who's maybe had a drink or two

I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight
Tonight

Outside the dawn is breaking, looks like it's started raining
We'll catch a cab, and soon be driving home
No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why
You'll know the reason just as soon as we get home
You've been sitting there, wondering what to do
I've been sitting here, waiting to make the first move
Ahaha

I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight (Tonight)
I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight
Tonight

This anticipation is a stimulation
No need for conversation as we're driving home
Put your arms around me, it doesn't mean you love me
Just that you want me and you need my company
Driving through the night, it's so exciting
Turning off the light without another thought tonight
Ahaha

I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight (I want a lover tonight)
I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight
Tonight
(I want you, I want your love)
(I want you, I want your love)
(I want you, I want your love)
Oooh


10. Later Tonight

You wait 'till later
'Till later tonight
You wait 'till later, 'till later
'Till later tonight

That boy never cast a look in your direction
Never tried to look for your affection
Dresses like the mod of your invention, tall and proud
He is the head boy of a school of thought
That plays in your intentions, night and day

And you wait 'till later
'Till later tonight
You wait 'till later, 'till later
'Till later tonight

And you wait 'till later
'Till later tonight
You wait 'till later, 'till later
'Till later tonight
'Cause tonight always comes


11. Why Don't We Live Together?

There comes a time in everyone's life
When all of the parties every night
They're not enough
You want something more ((Tell me))
I want you
I want you

(Tell)
(Tell)

I find you when I want you
And lose you late at night
The woman in me shouts out
The man in me just smiles
I may not always love you
You may not care
But if we should live together
There's something we could share
If we dare
Why don't we?

(Baby) Why don't we live together?
You won't believe in love until the day you try
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby))
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide

We'll find a home together
((Baby)) And sleep there every night
((Baby)) There's a time and place for most things
((Baby)) This time we'll get it right
((Aah)) You may not always love me
I may not care
But intuition tells me, baby
There's something we could share
If we dare
Why don't we?

(Baby) Why don't we live together?
You won't believe in love until the day you try
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby))
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide

Why don't we live together? ((together))
Together? ((together baby))
Why don't we live together? ((together))
Together?
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
(Baby)
((Ooh, baby, baby, sing about it))
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah

((Baby)) You may not always love me
I may not care
But intuition tells me, baby
There's something we could share
If we dare
Why don't we?

(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Ooh ooh))
You won't believe in love until the day you try
(Baby) Why don't we live together? ((Baby, baby))
With all the love we had, and all the love we hide ((Baby))

Why don't we live together? ((together))
Together? ((together baby))
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
((Baby, Ooh, baby))
((Sing about why don't we live together))

You won't believe until the day you try ((Baby, baby))
(Baby) Why don't we live together?
Why don't we live together?
(Baby) Why don't we live together? (Ooh ooh)
You won't believe in love until the day you try
(Baby)
Without the love, love you feel inside
