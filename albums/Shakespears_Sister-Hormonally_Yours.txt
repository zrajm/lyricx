1. Goodbye Cruel World

She likes to wake up and just fake it
She knows if she touches it she'll break it
She can see all the houselights fading
And the ground beneath her feet is shaking
She's singing bye bye my old friend
You're never going to see my face again
You left me outside in the rain
So bye bye mr A

Look out, just when you think she's wearing thin
She's walking out with the biggest man that you've ever seen
She's singing bye bye my old friend
You're never going to see my face again
It took some time but here I am 
So bye bye mr A

Well now her grass is looking greener
And you hope that sometimes you might see her
What a diamond, boy, looks like you missed it
It must have left you feeling sick and twisted
Bye bye my old friend
You're never gonna see my face again
You left me outside in the rain
So bye bye I said bye bye


2. I Don't Care

Walking through the rooms in my head
I came across your image
You looked at me with that sweet smile and said
Something they won't let me repeat
We hurt the ones we love the most
It's a subtle form of compliment

I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

Mark the spot you hate with an x
Then shoot your bow and arrow
Do your worst get it all off your chest
I'll hold my breath and swallow
We hurt the ones we love the most
It's a subtle form of discipline

I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

I don't care if you act like a queen
I don't care if you take it out on me
I've got 9 lives and I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

In a borealic iceberg came Victoria
Queen Victoria sitting shocked upon the rocking horse
Of a wave said to the laureate
This minx a course as sharp as any lynx
And blacker deeper than the drinks
As any hottentot without remorse
For the lynx said she and the drinks you can see
Are hot as any hottentot and not the goods for me
Hot as any hottentot and not the goods for me

I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

I don't care if you act like a queen
I don't care if you take it out on me
I've got 9 lives and I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care


3. Are We In Love Yet?

It's just another day in this crazy place
Well, don't you ever feel like you're losing the race
We're all on the same long road
To get where we want to go

Chorus
Are we in love yet? 
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet? 
That's what makes the world go round

Don't need a crystal ball to see what's going on
I can see the signs so come on everybody, let it shine, shine,
shine
Coz love makes you love somebody
Love turns you into somebody

(Repeat Chorus)

(Chorus Two)
Are we in love yet? 
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet? 
That's what makes the world go round

Are we in love yet? 
Don't you know that's what it's all about
Are we in love yet? 
Don't you know that makes the world go

Love's spinning, love's spinning round
Love's spinning, love's spinning round

Coz love makes you love somebody
Love turns you into somebody

Chorus (x3)


4. My Sixteenth Apology

The things I said about you
Maybe we could work it out someday

Things were going pretty well 'till I died
On that summer afternoon
When you broke down before my eyes
Well I got a streak of meanness
A clumsy way of speaking
And I don't know where I get it from
It must run in my family

Do I have to go down on my knees? 
This is my 16th apology to you
With friends like me who needs enemies

I got a river inside the size of my rage
Which is really something else
When you think of my tender age
Well I got a way about me
But it's hard for me to see it
And I don't know when I'm in the wrong
Why am I so hard to please? 

This is my 16th apology to you
Do I have to go down on my knees for you
With friends like me who needs enemies

The things I said about you
Were all said yesterday
I didn't mean to hurt you
Maybe we could work it out someday

Well I got a streak of meanness
A clumsy way of speaking
And I don't know when I'm in the wrong
Why am I so hard to please? 

Do I have to go down on my knees? 
This is my 16th apology to you
With friends like me who needs enemies

Didn't your mother ever tell you
To err is human, to forgive is divine
Oh well, I'll see you in the next life


5. Emotional Thing

I've seen the world from a first class seat
I've read 'The Bitch' and 'Ulysses'
I've tried religion and philosophy
And walked upon the sea

Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
It's just a suicidal whim
But I can't resist

(Chorus)
An emotional thing 
An emotional thing 
An emotional thing 
An emotional thing 
An emotional thing 

Now isolation can be sweet
No juvenile delinquent heat
I don't have to tell ya where I'm comingfrom
If I leave my cat suit on

Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
It's just a suicidal whim
But I can't resist


(Repeat Chorus)

Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
Now the air is getting thin
You make my senses start to spin
It's just a suicidal whim
But I can't resist an emotional thing...

(spoken passage) 

Chorus to fade 


6. Stay

If this world is wearing thin 
And you're thinking of escape 
I'll go anywhere with you 
Just wrap me up in chains 
But if you try to go alone 
Don't think I'll understand 

Stay with me 
Stay with me 

In the silence of your room 
In the darkness of your dreams 
You must only think of me 
There can be no in-between 
When your pride is on the floor 
I'll make you beg for more 

Stay with me 
Stay with me 

You'd better hope and pray 
That you make it safe 
Back to your own world 
You'd better hope and pray 
That you'll wake one day 
In your own world 

Because when you sleep at night 
They don't hear your cries 
In your own world 
Only time will tell 
If you can break the spell 
Back in your own world 

Stay with me... 


7. Black Sky

Come on, tune in to the light
Black sky, blue world, green eyes

And you'll come running
To the dark side of the moon
And 'though you'll never find us
We'll still be watching you

Come on, tune in to the life
Black sky, blue world, green eyes

No peace for the wicked
No rest for the good
No use in pretending
Love is in your blood

Come on, tune in to the light
Black sky, blue world, green eyes

Come on...


8. The Trouble With Andre

Some people say he has a deathwish
Trouble is he tends to agree
Let's not ask too many questions
It's nothing to do with you or me
He remembers a time when even going home was sweet
Now he can't feel the ground under his feet

And she said
"The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he hides everything"
But I know the trouble with andre
Is he's a liar

Inside the dresser by the table
Something he keeps beside the bed
Living with Andre can't be easy
Some things are better left unsaid
He remembers a time before the waters got so deep
When he found it easier to sleep

And she said
"The trouble with andre
Is he thinks he hides everything"
But I know the trouble with Andre
Is he's a liar

And you know
The trouble with Andre
Is he thinks he fools everyone
But I know the trouble with Andre
Is his disguise


9. Moonchild

Birds can fly and fish can swim
But on this planet where do I it in? 
I could be in trouble or just imagining
Sometimes I feel like an alien

I make them laugh I make them stare
But mr. Jones said "hey young girl
Don't you feel sorry for yourself
The world's out there"

There's a moonchild for everyone
Oh little moonchild you're not the only one!
There's a moonchild for everyone
Oh little moonchild you're not the only one!

I looked at the world from another star
That's when you discover who you really are

So if you think you'd like the taste
You know there's not much time to waste
So take off into outer space
I'll see you there! 

There's a moonchild for everyone
Oh little moonchild you're not the only one! 


10. Catwoman

I was floating around the atmosphere
I liked what I saw so I came down here
I was looking for something, looking for something

And the sky came up to meet with me
Magnetic forces greeted me
I was looking for something, looking for something

Chorus: 
I'm a superhuman 3-d baby
A Hollywood brainchild to drive you crazy
And I'm coming your way real soon
I'm the catwoman from the moon, from the moon

Now peace and love like a willow tree
Have hung their heads and wept for me
And I'm looking for someone, I'm looking for someone

So earth, don't you betray me
I'm willing to have your baby
Are you looking for someone, looking for someone

Chorus (x2) 

From the moon... 
I'm coming to get ya... 


11. Let Me Entertain You

She's the queen of cliche
Lit from the highest tower
She loves to entertain you
But she charges by the hour

Here among the flowers
Of faith and hope I stand
While you are buried in the mass
Of weeds you sowed by hand

You're looking for a saviour
A queen from tv
But if you want to trust someone
Well how about me

Let me entertain you
Is your soul for hire
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time

In a bar in oklahoma
She offered you a dream
But it turned into a coma
Well there are no in betweens
Sleep comes to the navyman
Who has to work the yard
But love's an added extra
You get when you're a star

Let me entertain you
Is your soul for hire
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time

Let me entertain you
Is your love for hire
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time

Don't you want to put your trust in
Someone who's not ordinary
Don't you want to put your trust in someone like me

Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

Let me entertain you
Is your heart for hire
Let me entertain you
Is your soul for hire

Let me entertain you
Is your love for hire
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time

Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Have you got the time


12. Hello (Turn Your Radio On)

Woke up this morning and the streets were full of cars
All bright and shiny like they'd just arrived from Mars
And as I stumbled through last nights drunken debris
The paperboy screamed out the headlines in the street

Another war and now the pound is looking weak
And tell me have you read about the latest freak? 
We're bingo numbers and our names are obsolete
Why do I feel bitter when I should be feeling sweet

Hello, hello turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there? 
Help me sing my song
La la la life is a strange thing
Just when you think you learned how to use it
It's gone

Woke up this morning and my head was in a daze
A brave new world has dawned upon the human race
Where words are meaning less and everything's surreal
Gonna have to reach my friends to find out how I feel

And if I taste the honey is it really sweet
And do I eat it with my hands or with my feet? 
Does anybody really listen when I speak
Or will I have to say it all again next week

Hello, hello turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there? 
Help me sing my song

Hello, hello turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there? 
Tell me what went wrong
La la la life is a strange thing
Life is a strange thing

Hello, hello turn your radio on
Is there anybody out there?
Help me sing my song
La la la life is a strange thing
Just when you think you learned how to use it
It's gone
