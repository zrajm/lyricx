1. Look 3

No kindness
When there's lack of dignity
Politeness
Has to join simplicity
No caution
Without pure sincerity
Compliance
Has to join with bravery
Bravery

No mildness
Without some solidity
No power
Without simple honesty
No courage
Without justice joined within
Good nature
And discretion makes a team
Makes a team

No mildness
Without some solidity
No power
Without simple honesty
No courage
Without justice joined within
Good nature
And discretion makes a team
Makes a team


2. Dewy Fields

Go
Go to seek and find
What you're hoping for

Come
The treasure is yours
You're running out of time

When morning comes
Your dreams are real
In dewy fields
Your trace is left behind
Behind

So very little time
So very little hope
But you're looking for someone
While the rain is falling down
Looking, seeking
You're searching for someone

When morning comes
Your dreams are real
In dewy fields
Your trace is left behind
Behind
Behind

So very little time
So very little hope
But you're looking for someone
While the rain is falling down
Looking, seeking
You're searching for someone

You're crossing the dewy fields
You're walking in the woods
There's someone catching up
They're watching over you
Keeping secret your precious thing
Your treasure is
Your enemy


3. Continuum

Embrujo, bajo el sol,
Cuando llueve y sube el calor
Mojando la piel

[[  Bewitchment under the sun
    When it rains and the heat goes up
    Getting the skin wet ]]

Ven aqui, junto a mi,
Mueve el aire y empuja el aqua
Apaga ese rumor

[[  Move the air and push the water
    Come here, beside me
    End that rumour(*)

    (* - Literally, "turn that rumour off". In spanish "rumor"
    can also be the distant sound of a river or rain water.) ]]

Alli no te detienes,
Giras y siempre te mueves
Una maldicion?

[[  There you don't stop
    You spin and always move
    A curse?
    And it forces you to dance
    Oh!, Oh!, and you can't stop
    It's a hidden, magic rhythm
    Continually ]]

Y te obliga a bailar
Ay ay y no puedes parar
Es un ritmo oculto, magico
Continuum

[[  Bewitchment under the sun
    When it rains and the heat tightens
    Getting my skin wet ]]

Embrujo, bajo el sol
Cuando llueve y aprieta el calor
Mojando mi piel

Ven aqui (ven aqui)
Junto a mi (junto a mi)
Mueve el aire y empuja el agua
Apaga ese rumor

[[  Come here, beside me
    Move the air and push the water
    End that rumour ]]

Alli no te detienes
Corres I siempre te mueves
Una maldicion ?

[[  There you don't stop
    You run and never stop
    A curse? ]]

Mama, ma, mama, mama
Ay, ay, y no puedes parar
En un ritmo oculto, magico
Continuum
Si...

[[  Mama, ma, mama, mama
    Oh, and you can't stop
    It's a hidden, magic rhythm
    Continually
    Yes... ]]

Es un ritmo oculto, magico
Continuum
Si...
Continuum, continuum, continuum...
Ritmo oculto, ritmo

[[  It's a hidden, magic rhythm
    Continually
    Yes...
    Continually, continually, continually...
    Hidden, magic rhythm ]]


4. The Suffering

My grief is deep, my days are dark
Give me a knock on my door
Say that you will be mine
And stay with me forever
As nothing can refresh my soul
I would have been happy to know
Cause I felt so safe when I looked into your eyes

I was mistaken but now I'm sure
I love you still
But silently inside
I know my feelings won't change your mind

So what am I gonna do
I gave away everything to you
I suffer from painful blows
Will it last forever?
But it's allright, I won't cry
Tears won't help me find the reason
Why you suddenly disappeared out of my sight

I was mistaken, but now I'm sure
I love you still
But silently inside
I know my feelings won't ever change your mind


5. The Glassmaker

6. Picnic on the Moon

Have I ever told you what I feel?
About what's to come and why we live
Ever since I was a little kid
I've been cautious and I've sealed my lips
But then I found this the book inside a drawer
A girl treasuring thoughts
Here's what I wrote:

That one day, we will fly
Together in a baron's air balloon
Straight up into the air
And when we have arrived
We'll take a little picnic on the moon
And watch the Earth below

I'm lost again
Needing a friend
'Cause I'm so alone

For the last time the sun is rising
I have a feeling
It's time we talk about it
'Cause I'm still on my own
I'm so alone


7. Intravenous

Send me a message
Escort me through the passage
Into the dark side of life
Let me slip into the eternity
I sense a light, a cave so bright
A cave so bright

Oh, what a trauma
Release me from this coma
Why won't they let me escape?
Drip, drip, intravenous emergency
And so in vain
They heal the stains and wounds on my body

So torn apart and bloody,
I do not wish to return
I don't wanna be one of the crippled ones
Do hear my prayer
Don't fade away
Don't fade away

Send me a message
Escort me through the passage
All I need is a sign
Skip, skip, Skip over this emergency
Forgive my sins, don't force me in

To live like a phantom
Still, this is nothing random
I'm meant to suffer and wait
But one minute more and it might be too late
So give a sign, I'm losing time


8. Oyster

The key to your box, it is out of my reach
I've been searching for it so long
If I could live in the open sea
I would surely have found the one
And I'd open the lid
Look in
See stones

Here by the shore, it's so quiet
And no pebbles for miles around
It's getting dark, and I wonder
If I ever will find my love
So please open the lid and bring the stones
'Cause the answer must come
From you
Alone

See I need some very few of
You blue pebbles
No real love; no aquamarines
Equitime points
Should I stay or go?

Tell me why do you hide inside the deep
With your jewellery box, the stones, the key
In the wave-clutter I can see your hair
Why won't you come near?
Why don't you dare?

See I need some very few of
You blue pebbles
No real love; no aquamarines
Equitime points
Should I stay or go?

I need a truehearted lover
Mermaid, bring me those stones


9. Birds of Passage

Feel the winds on the ridges
See the whirls in the meadows
The ice-capped reed announce
That the air is colder

I feel the strength of my heart
Quiver inside me
Buy I have no cure
For the lunger in your eyes

So don't ask that question
'Cause I don't know the reason why
It must be just like this
No don't ask that question
Believe me, I don't know why
It has to end this way

The wind will carry me away
The wind that would have killed us both
It saves my life
Your wish I'll keep in my mind
And if it won't come true
Our dream will dream

I don't know why
It must be like this
So, please, don't ask that question
Cause I don't have the answer

I don't know why
It has to end this way
So, please, don't ask that question
I don't know why

So don't ask that question
'Cause I don't know why it must be like this
So don't ask that question
'Cause I don't know why
It has to end this way


10. A Shoulder to the Wheel

You're conquered and the blood is pounding in your ears
But you're doing, doing, doing, doing fine
Find the broken pieces and then start anew
You make yourself believe that you did something right

You're denying your only wish
By forgetting your promises
Once and for all
Once and for evermore

If you finally reach your aim
You will never be able to
Gain back the time you lost in between
Once and for evermore
For evermore

You're trying hard to reconstruct your image
But you're doing, doing, doing, doing right
Yes, I think that you will always stay like this
When you put your idle shoulder to the wheel
To the wheel
To the wheel

You're denying your only wish
By forgetting your promises
Once and for all
Once and for evermore

If you finally reach your aim
You will never be able to
Gain back the time, to gain back the time

You're denying your only wish
By forgetting your promises
Once and for all
Once and for evermore

If you finally reach your aim
You will never be able to
Gain back the time you lost in between

A shoulder to the wheel


11. Time without End

Hope measuring time without end
You could be just like the sun
Beautiful like a dream
Innocent, innocent like a child
Heroic and brave
Like the kings and the warriors
In the legends

Behold the depths of your innermost soul
A minotaur walking in endless despair
Mythical like a dream
Invisible like a soft breath of wind
But still in your fantasy
This will always be real

I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desire
I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desire

I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desire
I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desire

I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desire
I'll show you who you are
I'll furnish you with a burning desire
