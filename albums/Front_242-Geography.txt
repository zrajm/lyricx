1. Operating Tracks

Standing so tall     / The ground behind
No trespassers       / On every floor
A garden swing       / And another door
She makes it clear   / That everything is hers

A place of abode
Not far from here
Ms. Van de Veer

All that belongs to  / No-one sees
Curtains that waver  / When evening falls
Inclosed by fences   / Smothered by wood
Who stands behind    / The shadows of the trees

A place of abode
Not far from here
Ms. Van de Veer

Standing so tall     / But no-one sees
No trespassers       / Whan evening falls
A garden swing       / Smothered by wood
Shw makes it clear   / The shadows of the trees


2. With Your Cries

Irrelevant questions
Queer responses with double meanings
Disordered,
Disorted voices
Coming from distant, dismal polar
climes
It makes you feel glad
It makes you take on a new lease of life
It makes you feel glad
It makes you fill the air with your cries


3. Art & Strategy


4. Geography II

There was a soldier
War material
Under the rain
Soulkilling, complain
And life to sustain
Pain - no pain
There will be ructions
More rebellions
Looting, rout
He's afraid of such a waste

There was a soldier
Warm material
Under the sun
For old acquaintances' sake
Don't make such a mistake
Please - oh please
There will be ructions
More rebellions
Looting, rout
Drugs tell upon one in time


5. U-Men

They seem to live in Panavision
On a TV screen or in a non-stop dream
UNIDENTIFIED MEN

I think it ain't just

At the first glance, I knew there was no chance
To come into contact or to find a new compact
UNIDENTIFIED MEN

I think it ain't just


6. Dialogues


7. Least inkling

There's no use fighting
I try to remain Unappalled
There's no use fighting
It leaves me provisionally quiet and cold

A sinking feeling
Is swiftly growing
I didn't have the least inkling
Of the plot they were weaving


8. GDVT

Where did you go?
I need to know
You always walk away
Though I'd like to stay

The place we'd meet
A distant street
And now I walk alone in vain
Wondering if you're still the same

I haven't found G.V.D.T yet
I only spoke with him on the phone
I haven't found G.V.D.T yet
I even don't remember why I've got to meet him
I haven't found G.V.D.T yet
It's an affair I will never forgat

What's wrong?

Corners I turn
Pictures I burn
I look over my shoulder
To the man who grows older
So will I find?
This search is blind
As I who cannot see
As you can run free


9. Geography I


10. Black White Blue


11. Kinetics


12. Kampfbereit

Einstein ist auf dem Strand nun
Und die Fahnen flattern
Einstein ist auf dem Strand nun
Traenenbenetzte Augen
Und der Wind laesst den fliegen
Handgranaten

KAMPFBEREIT
