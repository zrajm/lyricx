1. Tom Traubert's Blues

Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
I've got what I paid for now
see ya tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow
a couple of bucks from you, to go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, you'll go waltzing
Mathilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
and I'm tired of all these soldiers here
no one speaks English, and everything's broken
and my Stacys are soaking wet
to go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, you'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

now the dogs are barking
and the taxi cab's parking
a lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me
you tore my shirt open
and I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you buried the dagger in
your silhouette window light go to go
waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, you'll go waltzing 
Mathilda with me

now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her and the one-armed
   bandit knows, and the maverick Chinamen, and
the cold-blooded signs
and the girls down by the strip-tease shows go
waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, you'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

no, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say that the streets aren't for
   dreaming now
manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
they want a piece of the action anyhow go
waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, you'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

and you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor
and the old men in wheelchairs know
that Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
and she follows wherever you may go
waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, you'll go waltzing 
Mathilda with me

and it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace
and a wound that will never heal
no prima donna, the perfume is on
an old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
and goodnight to the street sweepers
the night watchman flame keepers
and goodnight to Mathilda too


2. Step Right Up

Step right up
step right up
step right up
Everyone's a winner, bargains galore
That's right, you too can be the proud owner
Of the quality goes in before the name goes on
One-tenth of a dollar
one-tenth of a dollar
we got service after sales
You need perfume? we got perfume
how 'bout an engagement ring?
Something for the little lady
something for the little lady
Something for the little lady, hmm
Three for a dollar
We got a year-end clearance, we got a white sale
And a smoke-damaged furniture
you can drive it away today
Act now, act now
and receive as our gift, our gift to you
They come in all colors, one size fits all
No muss, no fuss, no spills
you're tired of kitchen drudgery
Everything must go
going out of business
going out of business
Going out of business sale
Fifty percent off original retail price
skip the middle man
Don't settle for less
How do we do it?
how do we do it?
volume, volume, turn up the volume
Now you've heard it advertised, don't hesitate
Don't be caught with your drawers down
Don't be caught with your drawers down
You can step right up, step right up

That's right, it filets, it chops
It dices, slices, never stops
lasts a lifetime, mows your lawn
And it mows your lawn
and it picks up the kids from school
It gets rid of unwanted facial hair
it gets rid of embarrassing age spots
It delivers a pizza
and it lengthens, and it strengthens
And it finds that slipper that's been at large
under the chaise longe for several weeks
And it plays a mean Rhythm Master
It makes excuses for unwanted lipstick on your collar
And it's only a dollar, step right up
it's only a dollar, step right up

'Cause it forges your signature.
If not completely satisfied
mail back unused portion of product
For complete refund of price of purchase
Step right up
Please allow thirty days for delivery
don't be fooled by cheap imitations
You can live in it, live in it
laugh in it, love in it
Swim in it, sleep in it
Live in it, swim in it
laugh in it, love in it
Removes embarrassing stains from contour sheets
that's right
And it entertains visiting relatives
it turns a sandwich into a banquet
Tired of being the life of the party?
Change your shorts
change your life
change your life
Change into a nine-year-old Hindu boy
get rid of your wife
And it walks your dog, and it doubles on sax
Doubles on sax, you can jump back Jack
see you later alligator
See you later alligator
And it steals your car
It gets rid of your gambling debts, it quits smoking
It's a friend, and it's a companion
And it's the only product you will ever need
Follow these easy assembly instructions
it never needs ironing
Well it takes weights off hips, bust
thighs, chin, midriff
Gives you dandruff, and it finds you a job
it is a job
And it strips the phone company free
take ten for five exchange
And it gives you denture breath
And you know it's a friend, and it's a companion
And it gets rid of your traveler's checks
It's new, it's improved, it's old-fashioned
Well it takes care of business
never needs winding
Never needs winding
never needs winding
Gets rid of blackheads, the heartbreak of psoriasis
Christ, you don't know the meaning of heartbreak, buddy
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
'Cause it's effective, it's defective
it creates household odors
It disinfects, it sanitizes for your protection
It gives you an erection
it wins the election
Why put up with painful corns any longer?
It's a redeemable coupon, no obligation
no salesman will visit your home
We got a jackpot, jackpot, jackpot
prizes, prizes, prizes, all work guaranteed
How do we do it
how do we do it
how do we do it
how do we do it
We need your business
we're going out of business
We'll give you the business
Get on the business
end of our going-out-of-business sale
Receive our free brochure, free brochure
Read the easy-to-follow assembly instructions
batteries not included
Send before midnight tomorrow, terms available
Step right up
step right up
step right up
You got it buddy: the large print giveth
and the small print taketh away
Step right up
you can step right up
you can step right up
C'mon step right up
(Get away from me kid, you bother me...)
Step right up, step right up, step right up
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Step right up
you can step right up
c'mon and step right up
C'mon and step right up


3. Jitterbug Boy

Well, I'm a jitterbug boy
by the shoe-shine
resting on my laurels
and my Hardys too
life of Riley on a swing shift
gears follow my drift
Once upon a time I was
in show-biz too

I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers 
playin at Ebbets Field
seen the Kentucky Derby too
it's fast women, slow horses, I'm reliable sources
and I'm holding up a lamp post 
if you want to know
I seen the Wabash Cannonball, 
buddy, I've done it all

beause I slept with the lions 
and Marilyn Monroe
had breakfast in the eye 
of a hurricane
fought Rocky Marciano, 
played Minnesota Fats
burned hundred-dollar bills, 

I eaten Mulligan stew
got drunk with Louis Armstrong
what's that old song?
I taught Mickey Mantle 
everything that he knows

and so you ask me 
what I'm doing here 
holding up a lamp post
flippin this quarter, 
trying to make up my mind
and if it's heads I'll go to 
Tennessee, and tails I'll buy a drink
if it lands on the edge 
I'll keep talking to you


4. I Wish I Was in New Orleans

Well, I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
arm-in-arm down Burgundy
a bottle and my friends and me
hoist up a few tall cool ones
play some pool and listen to that 
tenor saxophone calling me home
and I can hear the band begin
"When the Saints Go Marching In"
by the whiskers on my chin
New Orleans, I'll be there

I'll drink you under the table
be red nose go for walks
the old haunts what I wants 
is red beans and rice
and wear the dress I like so well
and meet me at the old saloon
make sure there's a Dixie moon
New Orleans, I'll be there

and deal the cards roll the dice
if it ain't that ole Chuck E. Weiss
and Clayborn Avenue me and you
Sam Jones and all
and I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
arm-in-arm down Burgundy
a bottle and my friends and me
New Orleans, I'll be there


5. The Piano Has Been Drinking

The piano has been drinking
my necktie is asleep
and the combo went back to New York
the jukebox has to take a leak
and the carpet needs a haircut
and the spotlight looks like a prison break
cause the telephone's out of cigarettes
and the balcony's on the make
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking...

and the menus are all freezing
and the lightman's blind in one eye
and he can't see out of the other
and the piano-tuner's got a hearing aid
and he showed up with his mother
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking

cause the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler
cream puff casper milk toast
and the owner is a mental midget
with the I.Q. of a fencepost
cause the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking...

and you can't find your waitress
with a Geiger counter
And she hates you and your friends
and you just can't get served 
without her
and the box-office is drooling
and the bar stools are on fire
and the newspapers were fooling
and the ash-trays have retired
the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
The piano has been drinking
not me, not me, not me, not me, not me


6. Invitation to the Blues

Well she's up against the register
with an apron and a spatula
with yesterday's deliveries, 
and the tickets for the bachelors
she's a moving violation
from her conk down to her shoes
but it's just an invitation to the blues

and you feel just like Cagney
looks like Rita Hayworth
at the counter of the Schwab's drug store
you wonder if she might be single
she's a loner likes to mingle
got to be patient and pick up a clue

she says howyougonnalikem
over medium or scrambled
anyway's the only way
be careful not to gamble
on a guy with a suitcase
and a ticket gettin out of here
it's a tired bus station 
and an old pair of shoes
but it ain't nothing but an 
invitation to the blues

but you can't take your eyes off her
get another cup of java
and it's just the way she pours it for you
joking with the customers
and it's mercy mercy Mr. Percy
there ain't nothin back in Jersey
but a broken-down jalopy of a 
man I left behind
and a dream that I was chasin
and a battle with booze
and an open invitation to the blues

but she's had a sugar daddy
and a candy apple Caddy
and a bank account and everything
accustom to the finer things
he probably left her for a socialite
and he didn't love her 'cept at night
and then he's drunk and never 
even told her that he cared
so they took the registration
and the car-keys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation 
to the blues

'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving
local bus tonight, good evening 
you can have my seat
I'm stickin round here for a while
get me a room at the Squire
the filling station's hiring
I can eat here every night
what the hell have I got to lose
got a crazy sensation, 
go or stay and I've got to choose
and I'll accept your invitation to the blues


7. Pasties and a G-string

Smelling like a brewery,
looking like a tramp
I ain't got a quarter
got a postage stamp
Been five o'clock shadow boxing 
all around the town
Talking with the old men
sleeping on the ground
Bazanti bootin 
al zootin al hoot 
and Al Cohn
sharin this apartment 
with a telephone pole
and it's a fish-net stockings
spike-heel shoes
Strip tease, prick tease 
car kease blues
and the porno floor show
live nude girls
dreamy and creamy 
and the brunette curls
Chesty Morgan and a 
Watermelon Rose
raise my rent and take off 
all your clothes
with the trench coats
magazines bottle full of rum
she's so good, it make 
a dead man cum, with
pasties and a g-string
beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass 
and a Buffalo squeeze
wrinkles and cherry 
and twinky and pinky
and FeFe live from Gay Paree
fanfares rim shots 
back stage who cares
all this hot burlesque for me

cleavage, cleavage thighs and hips
from the nape of her neck 
to the lip stick lips
chopped and channeled 
and lowered and louvered
and a cheater slicks 
and baby moons
she's hot and ready
and creamy and sugared
and the band is awful 
and so are the tunes

crawlin on her belly shakin like jelly
and I'm getting harder than 
Chinese algebraziers and cheers
from the compendium here
hey sweet heart they're yellin for more
squashing out your cigarette butts 
on the floor
and I like Shelly
you like Jane
what was the girl with the snake skins name
it's an early bird matinee
come back any day
getcha little sompin
that cha can't get at home
getcha little sompin
that cha can't get at home
pasties and a g-string
beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass 
and a Buffalo squeeze
popcorn, front row
higher than a kite
and I'll be back tomorrow night
and I'll be back tomorrow night


8. Bad Liver and a Broken Heart

Well I got a bad liver and a broken heart
yea I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
and I don't have a drinking problem
cept when I can't get a drink
And I wish you'd a known her
we were quite a pair
she was sharp as a razor 
and soft as a prayer
so welcome to the continuing saga
she was my better half 
and I was just a dog
and so here am I slumped
I been chippied I been chumped 
on my stool
so buy this fool, some spirits and libations
it's these railroad station bars
with all these conductors and the porters
and I'm all out of quarters
and this epitaph is the aftermath
yea I choose my path
hey come on Cath, he's a lawyer, 
he ain't the one for ya
and no the moon ain't romantic
it's intimidating as hell
and some guy's trying to sell 
me a watch
And so I'll meet you at the 
bottom of a bottle of 
bargain Scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream
it's so maudlin it seems

you can name your poison
go on ahead and make some noise
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental
and it's purgatory, hey
what's your story, well
I don't even care
cause I got my own double-cross to bear

and I'll see your Red Label 
and I'll raise you one more
and you can pour me a cab, 
I just can't drink no more
cause it don't douse the flames 
that are started by dames
It ain't like asbestos 
it don't do nothing but 
rest us assured
and substantiate the rumors 
that you've heard.


9. The One That Got Away

The jigolo's jumpin salty
ain't no trade out on the streets
half past the unlucky
and the hawk's a front-row seat
dressed in full orquestration
stage door johnnys got to pay
and sent him home 
talking bout the one that got away

could a been on easy street
could a been a wheel
with irons in the fire 
and all them business deals
But the last of the big-time losers 
shouted before he drove away
I'll be right back as soon as I crack 
the one that got away

the ambulance drivers don't give a shit
they just want to get off work
and the short stop and the victim 
have already gone berserk
and the shroud-tailor measures him 
for a deep-six holiday
the stiff is froze, the case is closed 
on the one that got away

Jim Crow's directing traffic 
with them cemetery blues
with them peculiar looking trousers
them old Italian shoes
the wooden kimona was all ready 
to drop in San Francisco Bay
but now he's mumbling something 
all about the one that got away

Costello was the champion 
at the St. Moritz Hotel
and the best this side of Fairfax, 
reliable sources tell
but his reputation is at large
and he's at Ben Frank's every day
waiting for the one that got away

he's got a snake skin sportshirt, 
and he looks like Vincent Price
with a little piece of chicken 
and he's carving off a slice
but someone tipped her off 
she'll be doing a Houdini now any day
she shook his hustle
and a Greyhound bus'll 
take the one that got away

Andre is at the piano 
behind the Ivar in the sewers
with a buck a shot for pop tunes, 
and a fin for guided tours
He could of been in Casablanca
he stood in line out there all day
but now he's spilling whiskey 
and learning songs about a one that got away

well I've lost my equilibrium 
my car keys and my pride
tattoo parlor's warm 
and so I huddle there inside
the grinding of the buzz saw
whatchuwanthathingtosay
just don't misspell her name
buddy she's the one that got away


10. Small Change (Got Rained on with His Own .38)

Well small change got rained on with his own .38
and nobody flinched down by the arcade
and the marquise weren't weeping
they went stark-raving mad
and the cabbies were the only ones 
that really had it made
and his cold trousers were twisted, 
and the sirens high and shrill
and crumpled in his fist was a five-dollar bill
and the naked mannikins with their 
cheshire grins
and the raconteurs 
and roustabouts said buddy
come on in
cause the dreams ain't broken down here now
now ...they're walking with a limp
now that 

small change got rained on with his own .38"
and nobody flinched down by the arcade
and the burglar alarm's been disconnected
and the newsmen start to rattle
and the cops are tellin' jokes 
about some whore house in Seattle
and the fire hydrants plead the 5th Amendment
and the furniture's bargains galore
but the blood is by the jukebox 
on an old linoleum floor
and it's a hot rain on 42nd Street
and now the umbrellas ain't got a chance
And the newsboy's a lunatic 
with stains on his pants cause

small change got rained on with his own .38
and no one's gone over to close his eyes
and there's a racing form in his pocket
circled "Blue Boots" in the 3rd
and the cashier at the clothing store 
he didn't say a word as the
siren tears the night in half
and someone lost his wallet
well it's surveillance of assailants 
if that's whatchawannacallit
and the whores hike up their skirts 
and fish for drug-store prophylactics
with their mouths cut just like 
razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos
and her radiator's steaming 
and her teeth are in a wreck
now she won't let you kiss her
but what the hell do you expect
and the Gypsies are tragic and if you 
wanna to buy perfume, well
they'll bark you down like 
carneys... sell you Christmas cards in June
but...

small change got rained on with his own .38
and his headstone's 
a gumball machine
no more chewing gum 
or baseball cards or
overcoats or dreams and
someone is hosing down the sidewalk
and he's only in his teens

small change got rained on with his own .38
and a fistful of dollars can't change that
and someone copped his watch fob
and someone got his ring
and the newsboy got his porkpie Stetson hat
and the tuberculosis old men 
at the Nelson wheeze and cough
and someone will head south 
until this whole thing cools off cause
small change got rained on with his own .38
yea small change got rained on with his own .38


11. I Can't Wait to Get Off Work (And See My Baby on Montgomery Avenue)

Well I don't mind working
cause I used to be jerkin off 
most of my time in the bars
I been a cabbie and a stock clerk
and a soda fountain jock jerk
and a manic mechanic on cars
It's nice work if you can get it
now who the hell said it
I got money to spend on my girl
but the work never stops
and I'll be busting my chops
working for Joe and Sal.

And I can't wait to get off work to see my baby
she said she'd leave the porch lite on for me
I'm disheveled I'm disdainful
I'm distracted and it's painful
but this job sweeping up here
is gainfully employing me tonight

Tom do this, Tom do that
Tom... don't do that
count the cash, clean the oven
dump the trash, oh your lovin
is a rare and a copasetic gift
and I'm a moonlight watchmanic
it's hard to be romantic
(sweeping up over by the cigarette machine
sweeping up over by the cigarette machine...)

I can't wait to get off work to see my baby
she'll be waiting up with a magazine for me
clean 'em bathrooms, clean um good
oh your lovin I wish you would
come down here and sweep me off my feet
this broom'll have to be my baby
if I hurry, I just might 
get off before the dawns early light.
