1. Heroine

Oh baby the freezing cold
Oh baby the dead of night
Oh baby the blue blue flowers
Oh baby in the midnight hour

Chorus
I'll be your heroine
If they come knocking
I won't let them in
I'll be your heroine heroine

Oh baby just in time
Well maybe the night is mine
Oh baby don't forget
I'll save you it's not over yet

If you're feeling sick and it starts to rain
When you're in a fix I'll ease your pain

Chorus

Oh baby the telephone
Oh baby the devil's smile
Oh baby you're not alone
Don't worry I'll stay a while

I can hold your hand when the night is dark
In this foreign land I'm your Joan of Arc

Chorus

I'm your heroine
And if they come knocking
I won't let them in
I'm your heroine


 2. Run Silent


 3. Dirty Mind

Ladies and gentleman
For your listening pleasure
Live from England: 
The solid state sound of pure sex...

In the corner shops times are hard
Faces thin as credit cards
I walk past posters selling simple sex, ooh!
And all the records using cheap effects
I'm going down to the station in the heart of town
To buy a ticket just to hang around

Chorus
I've got a dirty mind
I've got a dirty mind
Take a look at yourself

You stare are you looking at me
Or just an image from your colour TV
Dollar signs and neon lights
Shine on the people every night
I'm going down to the river to wash my sins away
But they'll be back tomorrow anyway

Chorus

I've got imagination
I got hallucinations
Do you want some?

Chorus

[The 1990 version adds a rap written by Dave Stewart]
Smelling like a rose 
Looking like a queen 
I'll have a double dose 
If you know what I mean 
Went down to the river 
With no one to trust 
When you know what you want 
Then you do what you must 
But you'd better think smart 
And take my advice 
Just think of nothing 
And double it twice 
I bought you a trumpet 
And a brand new suit 
Just don't be disappointed 
When you lick the fruit]


4. Sacred Heart


5. Heaven Is In Your Arms

I remember you back in '83 
Singing in the rain 
In sweet harmony 
I get so lonely 
As the pages turn in my history 
You fade away like a mystery 
I get so lonely

Chorus
Heaven is in your arms dear 
Heaven is in your arms dear 
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Heaven is in your arms dear 
Heaven is where you are 
I will never leave you 
I will never let you go

If you never come back into my
life 
I'll cut these strings with a golden knife 
I won't be lonely, I won't be lonely 
I'll steal your body from the hall of fame 
So the U.S.A. will know my name 
I get so lonely, I get so lonely

Chorus

I read in this month's Passion
magazine 
Or was I just imagining things? 
It seemed so real 
I've got something that you left behind 
A picture of you in my mind

Chorus


6. Twist The Knife


7. You're History


8. Break My Heart

With your new shoes and your black
moods
You really break my heart
With your world acclaim and your family name
You really break my heart
Wrapped up warm in yourself tonight
You wonder why things aren't going right

Chorus
You really break my heart
You really break my heart
I bleed for you
You really break my heart
You really break my heart

Got a good looking lover don't
need any other
To break my heart
Reading highbrow books just to cultivate your looks
You really break my heart
Watch out here's another breakdown
You wonder what caused it this time 'round

Chorus

Home most nights with the TV on
You don't want to be with anyone

Chorus


9. Red Rocket


10. Electric Moon

I know what you're thinking 
Don't want to make you blue 
I'm heading out this evening 
Looking for electric moon

Chorus
Electric moon 
Electric moon 
Electric moon 
Electric moon

You know I love you darling 
I'm dancing to your tune 
Something snapped inside my brain 
Under an electric moon

Chorus

Dogs come out at midnight 
In this troubled land 
Going's tough and I've had enough 
So here I make my stand

I said, going's tough and I've
had enough 
So here I make my stand

You can trust me daddy 
You know I'll do you right 
Let me have my fun this evening 
You've got all tomorrow night

Chorus

I wanna see the sparks fly 
Electric moon 
I wanna see the stars shine 
Electric moon 
That old moon's got me in its spell 
Wow...


11. Primitive Love


12. Could You Be Loved?

Could you be loved and be loved

Could you be loved and be loved

Don't let them fool you 
Or even try to school you, oh! no 
We've got a mind of our own 
So go to hell if what you're thinking 
Is not right 
Love would never leave us alone 
In the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be loved

Could you be loved and be loved

The road of life is rocky 
And you may stumble too 
So while you point your fingers 
Someone else is judging you

Could you be, could you be, could
you be loved 
Could you be, could you be loved

Don't let them change you 
Or even rearrange you, oh! no 
We've got a life to live 
They say only, only 
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive 
Stay alive

Could you be loved and be loved

Could you be loved and be loved

You ain't gonna miss your water

Until your well runs dry 
No matter how you treat him 
The man will never be satisfied

Could you be, could you be, could
you be loved 
Could you be, could you be loved


13. You Made Me Come To This

I'm gonna bury my head 
Just for you 
I'll be your silicone doll 
If you want me to 
I won't tell you what I'm thinking 
You'd never guess 
That what I am is of your making 
It's you who made me come to this

Chorus: 
You made me come to this 
It's you who made me come to this

I'm gonna colour my hair Hollywood

Dress up like you think I should 
I won't show you what I'm thinking 
You wouldn't get the gist 
That what I am is of your making 
It's you who made me come to this

Hey, remember what I did to please you? 
I hung around with all your stupid friends 
I smiled in all the right places 
And still you didn't notice my new leather catsuit, did ya?!
