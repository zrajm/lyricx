1. Heart of Lilith

She has come from the shadows of the dream world
A dark angel from the darker side of love
Across the Sea of tears
A hundred thousand years

Come with her, and dance in the moonlight
And you are lost to this world evermore
Put your hand in her hand

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith

Come and drown in the lake of her passion
Come and die so you can be reborn
Hear the sirens sing
Hear the death knell ring

She the witch, the siren, and the vampire
She has come from the distant stars
To take your heart
To break your heart

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like the phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith

Come and kiss, kiss the lips of Lilith
Come and kiss, and you will be no more
Feel the fire, of desire

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like a phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith

Come and fly now with the angels
Rise again now like a phoenix
You're the love that lives forever
In the heart that never dies, never dies
Heart of Lilith


2. Woman to Hare

Woman to cat to hare and back
Woman to cat to hare
I shall go with care
A woman with power may fool a man
As a hare I shall go from his sight
To most anywhere

Racing with the wind behind me
Chasing 'cross the fields of green
Running with the speed a hare can
Never shall this hare be seen

A woman, not a hare, shall snare a man
But the hare and the cat shall know
Where'er he's at
His secrets and his solitude shall not be his
For a man with a plan and a mind
I wish not to find

Racing with the wind behind me
Chasing 'cross the fields of green
Running with the speed a hare can
Never shall this hare be seen

Racing with the wind behind me
Chasing 'cross the fields of green
Running with the speed a hare can
Never shall this hare be seen

I have watched many men in their beds as they lie
As a cat I have sat and I know
What I should not know
They may think they are strong and are brave and they rule this world
But with quiet and with magick and with hare
They do not compare

Racing with the wind behind me
Chasing 'cross the fields of green
Running with the speed a hare can
Never shall this hare be seen

Racing with the wind behind me
Chasing 'cross the fields of green
Running with the speed a hare can
Never shall this hare be seen


3. Hail the Holly King

All across the virgin snow
And through the naked trees
On a cold winter's night
His song is on the breeze
Where the moonlight paints the frost
Upon the robin's song
He's come a-calling for us all
Now the summer's gone!

Hark! Hear the children sing
Glory to the Holly King
Let the jingle bells all ring
Hail, hail the Holly King

In the whisky and in the wine
He is here this Yule-tide time
A-dancing in the home-fire flames
A-dancing, singing, playing games
When the prayers are to the East
He is with us at the feast
His crown is nailed to the door
He's with us forevermore!

Underneath the mistletoe
He is in all lover's hearts
He fans the flames of desire
'Tis he who fires Cupid's darts
He is in all children's dreams
Dressed in red or dressed in green
Riding on the astral sleigh
He's the spririt of the day!


4. Wake of the Christian Knights

From old Rome they come a-riding
On a song with armour shining
Christian sons with hearts of anger
Bring the book, the cross, the chancre
Hallelujah, hallelujah, kiss the cross or they will burn you
Hallelujah, hallelujah, they have come to rape and murder

Tell them we've had it all
They've had their day now they shall fall
Tell them of the turning tide
They can run but they can't hide

Across a sea of tears and blood
Across a scape of murdered babies
They will cleanse and purify
For their Christ and for their Lady
They will take the joy of love and
Name it as a badge of shame
They will steal and they will plunder
They will tell you you're to blame

Tell them we've had it all
They've had their day now they shall fall
Tell them of the turning tide
They can run but they can't hide

On the wheel and on the gibbet
Broken bodies, broken dreams
In the churches, the sheep, the traitors
Now they are both pure and clean
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Tell them we've had it all
They've had their day now they shall fall
Tell them of the turning tide
They can run but they can't hide

Tell them we've had it all
They've had their day now they shall fall
Tell them of the turning tide
They can run but they can't hide

Tell them we've had it all
They've had their day now they shall fall
Tell them of the turning tide
They can run but they can't hide


5. Paint it Black

[[original by Rolling Stones]]

...and I want to paint it black
turn black
I had to turn..
never to turn back


6. All Along the Crooked Way

Underneath the darkened sky
All along the crooked way
The same story once again
Of sorrow and of pain
One fool in a dream
One black-hearted queen
A tale of unrequited love
That's written in tears, written in blood
She smiles, he cries
He begs, but she denies
As tonight becomes tomorrow
All joy will turn to sorrow

This is a tale of a succubus
A tale of love, pain and lust
And death, and death!

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Where there's love, there is lust
Where there's a boy to give his heart
There's a woman to tear it apart
Where there's giving, there's taking
There's faking, and there's breaking
Where there's trust deceit's right there
The dream becomes the nightmare!

To despair she'll take him
A shadow she'll make him
Before hi, the open grave
On his wrist, the razor blade
Young man, hang your head and cry
It's time to suffer, time to die
Abandon you the dreams of youth
Abandon love, hope and truth!

She will crush you, she'll excite you
She'll destroy you, she'll ignite you
She'll take you to a world of darkness
And eath, and death!

On a night of dread and wonder
Hear her heartbeat turn to thunder
Now's the time for soul surrender
And death, and death!


7. The Witch of Berkeley

A woman liked by all who ever knew her
A hedonist who lived life for the day
She fed her soul on feasting and with riches
And feared the day that she would have to pay

Her raven came, one evening to her table
And warned her soon she'd pay out for her sins
She cried alound, `My merry days are over'
`For now's the time my troubles shall begin'

You can't cheat your day of reckoning
For fate chatches up with you
For this is your day of reckoning now

Fhe days that came were filled with many sorrows
And soon our witch was taken to her bed
Her children came, a monk and nun to see her
And as she died, they reeled at what she'd said

Within her tomb, her body wrapped in deer hide
And triple chains to guard her mortal soul
Then demons came and smashed two chains asunder
The third or iron, Old Nick destroyed alone

9. Vampyre Erotica

Your heart burns for love
My soul burns for blood
I'll take you, I'll break you
I'll crush you, I'll break you
If you want me, I'll need you
I'll kill you, feed from you
I'll take you down that road
That leads to destruction

Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love

I can't feed my hunger
Your youth makes me younger
I'll hurt you, desert you
Turn your dreams to nightmares
I'll cheat you, I'll eat you
I'll maim you, I'll drain you
Come to me, come to me
To the dark side where love sleeps

Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love

Come along and talk with me
Sing the sweet song of despair
Give your body, give your soul
In the furnace of our love

I'll hurt you, you'll love me
I'll scratch you, I'll cut you
You'll kiss me, then miss me
I'll laugh at your torment
I'll have you, and own you
Be hard and cold to you
I'll be your dark angel
I'll be your worst nightmare

Come and take a walk with me
Where the angels fear to tread
Kiss the flame, feel the pain
In the furnace of our love

Come along and talk with me
Sing the sweet song of despair
Give your body, give your soul
In the furnace of our love

I need you, I'll scold you
I'll touch you, I'll hold you
I'll take you, I'll bite you
I'll calm you, exite you
I'll love you, I'll need you
I'll kiss you, I'll kill you
I'll beat you, I'll eat you
I'll crush you, I'll thrill you
I'll scratch you, attack you
Destroy you, devour you
I'll hold you, I'll hurt you
I'll maim you, I'll drain you

Consuming
Consuming
Consuming
Consuming

I'll have you, I'll hold you
Resent you, I'll drop you
I'll hit you, I'll kick you
I'll hate you, forsake you
Deny you, defy you
Condemn you, desert you
I'll cut you, I'll scratch you
I'll harm you, disarm you
I'll need you, I'll hold you


10. Wild Hunt

Herne, Herne, Herne, Herne!

Come with bright eyes a-flashing
Come with your dark hounds crashing
Come rend the sky asunder
Come with the rain and thunder
Break all that lies before you
Take all that dies around you
Ride with the Hounds of Hell
Fly with the Hounds of Hell

Take me to the Wild Hunt
Break me with the Wild Chase
Take me with the Wild Hunt
Take me riding wildly with the Wild Hunt now

In darkest green you move now
With oak and ash and thorn now
The cloak that's swathed around you
Denies I've finally found you
I've sought your untamed beauty
Within the hearts of men
I've found both love and cruelty
In equal parts within

Come with those bright eyes flashing
And with your hounds a-crashing
I feel I've always known you
Tho' none would ever own you
Proud Herne to ride beside you
And leave the dying day
But who knows who is hunted
And who shall be the prey?


11. Sweet Morpheus

Falling downward, your face I see
Falling downward, you can see me
In this madness I reach out for your hand
Two souls in union, spiralling to the ground

Child of Morpheus
Take me to your sweet euphoria
Child of Morpheus
Hold me in my dreams
Tranquil angel
Falling with no fear of landing
Child of Morpheus
Close my eyes for me

I've touched your beauty, tasted your poison brew
You've held me closer than any man could do
Now come, sweet Morpheus, there's lands we've yet to see
Unfold your comforting arms, and we'll fall endlessly

How I love you, Morpheus, my soul has ached for you
You gave me comfort while life was so cruel
Your time is precious, I'll waste not what you share
Let's fall again now, as far as we would dare


12. Hell-fire

So much we'd learn in this age of denial
Wild Rabelaisians to teach us their pleasures
Do what you will we could all learn to live by
Though guilt and torment are our only treasures

Hell-Fire and brimstone and blasphemy be mine
Liberty reign with Sir Francis for all time
Do what you will and evour all that's divine
Hell-Fire and brimstone and blasphemy be mine

Strange tales are told of their nights filled with pleasure
Of wild excesses and boundless debauchery
I'd take irreverence and sweet Breast of Venus
If faith and wafers was all I was offered

Deny yourself and deny you are living
Deprive yourself and you'll die knowing nothing
Though some would say we are mad in His likeness
We're flesh and blood and there's so much to drink of


13. Whore of Babylon
