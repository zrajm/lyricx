1. (I'm the) Radio King Kong

You're stupid and you're insane
Sufferin' from lack of brains
Twentyfour hour pain
What you need's a healin' rain

...Yeah ...yeah

You sinners of this screwed-up race
People of wrong kind of faith
Salvation's on its way
Rollin' in from outer space

...Yeah ...yeah

I'm the radio king kong
I'm the radio king kong

...Kiss me...

The hero of the century
Saviour of the galaxy
I will land on the earth
I'll save you from the curse

...yeah ...yeah

I'm the radio king kong

Velvet voice from the skies
People stare with zombie eyes
In the air - everywhere
Am I real? Do you care?

...Do you care?
...Do you care?
...I don't care

I'm the radio king kong
I'm the radio king kong
The king of pop


2. Do the Monkey (Hitch-Hike to Mars)

Monkeys like me eat
Bananas and speed
Monkeys like me dig the
Houdini scene

Monkeys like me...
Monkeys like me...

Monkeys like me
Never never fall asleep

Hitch-hike to mars
Don't you wanna leave this world...
And hitch-hike
Hitch-hike to mars

Monkeys like me feel
Trapped in a cage
Monkeys like me think of
Nothin' but escape

Monkeys like me...
Monkeys like me...

Monkeys like me
Know there's no place like space

Hitch-hike to mars
Hitch-hike...

Do the Monkey with me
Do the Monkey with me


3. Be My TV

Tell me a secret
Tell me a lie
I don't care
I just wanna stay up all night

Be my religion
Be my bright light
Give me a rerun
Of your chewing-gum smile

Be... my... be my tv
Be... my... be my tv

Give me a real bore
Give me a thrill
I don't care
I got a billion hours to kill

Give me the real thing
Say have a nice day
Kiss me like they do
In commercial breaks

Be... my... be my tv
Be... my... be my tv

I wanna feel you
Close my skin
I wanna feel
The power you bring

Television girl
Television world
You know I love my
Television world

Be... my... be my tv
Be... my... be my tv

I switch you on
I switch you off


4. This is Trash

Well I'm cute. ok
But boy I am stupid
I ain't got no brains
But don't tell my groupies

This is just what I need
This is such a relief
This is...
This is this is trash

I'm gonna teach the masses
With my dum-dum song
I'm gonna kick your asses
I'm the new king kong

This is just what I need
This is such a relief
This is...
This is this is trash

Yeah, I love this nonsense
I gotta million bucks
I'm a major fuck up
I was born with luck

This is...

Love this...
Trash

Let me hypnotize you
Let me take control
Let me radiate your
Stupid little soul
I'll give you heaven
I'll give you Broadway

I'll give you the empire states

Let me mesmerize you
Let me come inside
There's no way to escape
This look in my eyes
You know I need flesh
You know I need flesh
Don't you worry honey
I'll clean up all the mess

The American

The American psycho wants


6. Futurehead

There's a spaceship in my garden
Someone's knockin' on my door
There's a billion androids screamin'
Don't you wanna get onboard

Wow... Alright

We're off to new dimensions
And digital blue moon
We're goin' on a rocket
Bye-bye you silly fools

Wow... Oh yeah

The future is in my head

We're goin on a highway
The speed injection route
Never stop for nothin'
Ain't got no time to lose

Wow... Oh yeah

We're goin' with a bang
We're goin' with a boom
We're goin' with a smile
Into the great unknown

Wow... Oh yeah

The future is in my head


7. What's Wrong

The chance to begin again
In a golden land of opportunity and adventure
The chance
The chance
The chance
The chance
The chance

What's wrong?
I need something stronger
Take four red capsules


8. Nutopia

Let's get really serious
Let's stay drunk for weeks
Let's forget the world
Yeah, let's scream like Jerry Lee

Hey!
Hey!

If you're bored with bein' a white ass
Paint yourself green
Build yourself a city
Put it on four wheels

Drive around the stratosphere
Burn out on cosmic street
Never pay with money
Everything's for free

(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on)

Well, I do believe democrazy
Is good for you and me
Everyone needs a nuclear bomb
And we can all maintain the peace

This could be a hobby
This could be a ball
This could mean equality
Equality for all

(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on) Hey! Hey hey!
(Come on)

The chance to begin again
In a golden land of opportunity and adventure
And the right to be a pig

(What's wrong?)
(What's wrong?)
(What's wrong?)
(What's wrong?)

Let's get really serious
Let's stay drunk for weeks
Let's get really serious
Yeah, let's scream like Jerry Lee

Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Hey! Hey hey!
Woooow!

10. Dog Church

I'm psykedelik
I'm on weed
I'm on welfare
I'm on speed
I meet Jesus
On the street
I stop and ask him
How he feels

Fire-crackers in my head
Saturation flashin' red
Radioaktive insekt eyes
Lookin' for a perfekt vice

Come with me to the dog church
Come with me to the church
The dog church

Blade Runner people in a neon haze
Soft 'xplodin' video space
Cyber junkies toxic youth
Liquid dreams hi-tech blues

Come with me to the...

Nuklear money nuklear skies
Nuklear power in my head alright
Sub-distortion screamin' sound
X-ray spex make the world go round

Come with me...

Let's get religious
Let's light a candle
Let's share a pizza
In the dog
Dog church
