1. Sacrifice

No, I can't see tomorrow when I close my eyes
There is no tomorrow, my gift is of no use

What's the horse on the shore waiting for?

See, today wears a mask, today is a shadow
Today is meant to drag down, shelter and devour
Today is a gift fading beforehand
Today is a feast ending too early

break:  Albeit unseen, albeit unveiled
                There's a troublemaker
                Hiding heavy secrets

If I don't see tomorrow then it must be black
It's a land of sorrow full of deadened groans
Tomorrow has no colors, it feels like the night
It's a pile of cinders instead of a fire
They did raze tomorrow to the ground


2. Rhythm of Time

What's outside?
The beat of the nation
The stadium of Zonk
The heart of the city
The real world
Retaliation
Burning flags
The pressure of daily life
Nothing to be afraid of

We believe in the future of the human race

What's inside?
The pulsing blood
Turmoil and chaos
Noises, images
The rhythm of time
We dream of the mating season
Feel a coming tidal wave
We want to run but cannot move
'Cause we're embedded in concrete

chorus: come on

Sixty three
Who's mister X?
Get up
We live in a fairy tale
We swim along with the whales
We dream of evergreen trees
Wake up in heart-rending cries
Good morning

What's above
Desire, survival
An almighty God
Like a hanging sword
New planets to conquer


3. Moldavia

It flies
The U-Fly gets in your ear
The U-Fly gets to your brain
The U-Fly sticks on your nerves
Grips on your blood pressure
Drives you to more pleasure

U-Fly magic touch on your head
Down to your tips
Now start to move and dance
Now start to groove in trance

Stand up, you electronic insect
Stand up, you electronic force

No sign of mortal bite
Just keep on flying, all right!

Now, you're an electronic insect
Now use your electronic force

Blood pressure
More pleasure
It flies


4. Trigger 2 (Anatomy of A Shot)

[instrumental]


5. Gripped By Fear

Recession repression regression
Recession repression regression
Shifts of scenery
And warning tremors of landslides

The sky comes down
The mountains move aside
Your kingdom slips out of your hands
The sky comes down
The mountains move aside
Your kingdom slips out of your hands

Your tyranny
I was part of
Is now cracking
On every side
And your own life
Is in danger
Your empire
Is on fire

The staggering blows
Are shaking the walls
Nowhere, no place to hide this time
The staggering blows
Are shaking the walls
Nowhere, no place to hide this time

Your tyranny
I was part of
Is now cracking
On every side
And your own life
Is in danger
Your empire
Is on fire
Is on fire
Is on fire
Is on fire
Is on fire

There is more sand than oil in your engine
Calm down, flare up, flare up
Calm down, flare up, flare up
Calm down, flare up, flare up
Calm down, flare up, flare up

Your tyranny
I was part of
Is now cracking
On every side
And your own life
Is in danger
Your empire
Is on fire


6. Tragedy >For You<

With that skill that was hers alone
She drove her clutches into me
I was dumbfounded
She was hungry
She required me entirely

All that's left is here to remain
It's a dull and cruel pain
That passes the ages unaltered
Her stamp is in my heart
I still feel disemboweled
I clearly retain
A blank
The void
The sore in my soul
The mark in my heart
Her acid reign

Hot sun, global fun
Needed action, start to run
Hot sun, global fun
Needed action, start to run
Start to run
Start to run
Start to run

The sore in my soul
The mark in my heart
Her acid reign

[Red Rover, Red Rover
Send David right over]

And that voice that was hers alone
Still resounds in me
She left me dislocated
Disavowed
And twitching
Her rhythm is in my heart
She inspired in me
An acute sense of treachery

Hot sun, global fun
Needed action, start to run
Hot sun, global fun
Needed action, start to run

I clearly retain
[Needed action, start to run]
A blank
[Needed action, start to run]
The void
[Needed action, start to run]

The sore in my soul
The mark in my heart
Her acid reign
Her acid reign


7. The Untold

It darkens our sayings
[Darkens our sayings]
Curses our wills
[Curses our wills]
Forces our needs
[Forces our needs]
Lessens our skills
[Lessens our skills]

The untold
Rottens our actions
[Bites our soul]
Peels our heart
[Digs our grave]
Punishes disclosure
And never gets rattled

The untold
The untold
Rottens our actions
[Bites our soul]
Peels our heart
[Digs our grave]
Punishes disclosure
And never gets rattled
It's the untold

The untold
[The untold]
Raises our greed
[Raises our greed]
Glides on the air
[Glides on the air]
Circles around
[Circles around]

The dive in the shelter
[The dive in the shelter]
The paper one crinkles
[The paper one crinkles]
It's the untold, the untold

[Rottens our actions]
Rottens our actions
Leaks our failures

You don't believe me?


8. Neurobashing

Pull up
Pull down, yeah!

Cool off
Cool down, yeah!

Put the pain out of me, yeah!

Cool off
Cool up
Jan up, yeah!

Jezebel spirit...

Heh, eh, eh
I got to tell it yeah!
I've got to tell it, take it down!
Your father won't tell it...
If I don't tell it

I'm gonna be ready
Cool off
Cool down, yeah!

Do insist
I'm gonna be ready!


9. Leitmotiv 136

Something is wrong
He falls
Betraying the trust
There's a disaster in his life


10. Soul Manager

I'm the guide of the lost
I'm the friend of the weak
From underneath the cowl
I'm staring at your soul
I see it black, I see it small

I feel the weight of the sins you haul
I'm the trusting friend you need
You're the open book I read

chorus: I'm here to save you

I see you sail night and day
On a sea where the waves
Always force you back
It won't take me more than one strike
To release your soul from the cares of life
I'm your guide through the night
Through the night to the light

I see you sink deeper down
In an ocean of pain
Always force them down
You shouldn't be afraid
I'm your everlasting mate
Always force you down

A voice pierces your ears
My words enter your brain
