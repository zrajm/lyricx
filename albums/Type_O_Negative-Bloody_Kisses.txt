1. Machine Screw

Easy... Easy...
Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...
A-ohh... Mmm...
Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...
Ohh... Ohh...


2. Christian Woman
   a) Body Of Christ (Corpus Christi)
   b) To Love God
   c) J.C. Looks Like Me

(Forgive her, for she knows not what she does.)

A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

A dying God-man full of pain
When will you cum again ?
Before him beg to serve or please
On your back or knees
There's no forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment ?
Would you suffer eternally
Or internally ?

For her lust
She'll burn in hell
Her soul done medium well
All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

Corpus Christi
She needs 
Corpus Christi
Corpus Christi

Corpus Christi
She needs 
Corpus Christi
Corpus Christi

Body of Christ
She needs
Body of Christ
Body of Christ

She'd like to know God
Ooh, love God
Feel her God
Inside of here - deep inside of her

She'd like to know God
Love God
Feel, feel, feel her God
Inside of here - deep inside of her

Inside of here - deep inside of her

Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, ahh

Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, ahh
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, ahh

Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, yeah
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, ahh
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, yeah
Jesus Christ looks like me, Jesus Christ, ahh


3. Black no. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All)

(I went looking for trouble
Good boy, I found her)

She's in love with herself
She likes the dark
On her milk white neck
The Devil's mark
Now, it's all Hallows Eve
The moon is full
Well, will she trick or treat?
- I bet she will
...she will

(Happy halloween)

She's got date at midnight
With Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lilly Munster
Ain't got nothing on you
Well when I called her evil
She just laughed
And cast that spell on me
Boo Bitch Craft

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ohh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black no. 1
Black, black, black, black no. 1

Little wolf skin boots
And clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral
For witch she's dressed
Her perfume smells like
Burning leaves
Every day is Halloween

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ohh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black no. 1
(She dye's them black)
Black, black, black, black no. 1
(Black no. 1)

Loving you, loving you
Love, love, loving you was like loving the dead

Loving you, loving you
Love, love, loving you was like loving the dead

Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
...was like loving the dead
...was like loving the dead

(Superblue)

Loving you, loving you
Love, love, loving you was like loving the dead
...was like fucking the dead

Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead

Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
...was like loving the dead
...was like loving the dead

Black, black, black, black no. 1
(She dye's them black)
Black, black, black, black no. 1
(Black no. 1)

Black, black, black, black no. 1
Black, black, black, black no. 1


4. Fay Wray Come Out And Play

Astro spectra, aspilega...
Astro spectra, aspilega...
(¿?)
Aaaaahhhh!


5. Kill All The White People

Kill all the white people
Then we'll be free


6. Summer Breeze

See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a friday night
A little light-a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything's all right

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the door step
Through the screen and across the floor

Sweet days of summer - the jasmine's in bloom
July dressed up and playing her tune
And I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there
Not a care in the world

See the smile awaitin in the kitchen
Food cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through


7. Set Me On Fire

Summer girl
Set me on fire
Summer girl
Set me on fire


8. Dark Side Of The Womb


9. We Hate Everyone

Right wing commies
Leftist Nazis
Point their fingers
Rumours linger

We don't care what you thin

Branded sexist
Labelled racist
Want it clearer ?
Check the mirror

We don't care what you think

Lies and slander in vain try to shame us
Riots, protests, violence just makes us famous
TV interviews, free publicity
Increase record sales dramatically

The left they say I'm a facist
The right calling me communist
Hate hate hate hatred for all - one and all
No matter what you believe
Don't believe in you - and that's true

Some would say that we're biased
Accusations that we are racist
Well, shit comes in all hues
Now this means you
Cause things ain't always like they seem

We hate everyone

We don't care what you think


10. Bloody Kisses (A Death In The Family)

not long ago but far away
A rainy winter's day
All her pain she kept inside
Could no longer hide
No cry for help
She killed herself
Both life & love could not be saved
She took them both to the grave

A pair of souls become undone
Where were two now one
Devided by this wall of death
I soon will join you yet
With my blood I'll find your love
You found the strength to end you life
As you did so shall I

Oh no
Please don't go
It's like a death in the family

A crimson pool so warm & deep
Lulls me to an endless sleep
Your hand in mine - I will be brave
Take me from this earth
An endless night - this, the end of my life
From the dark I feel your lips
And I taste your bloody kiss

Oh no
Please don't go
It's like a death in the family

Don't die on me
Don't die on me
Don't die on me
Dont' die


11. 3.O.I.F.


12. Too Late: Frozen

So you've come to say you're very sorry
"It won't happen again - forgive me ?"
Time will not heal these wounds
And I'm bleeding because of you

Was everything we had just a joke ?
I've run out of patience, tears and hope
Love does not conquer all
And I'm screaming because of you

Too late for apologies

In the shadow of the light from a black sun
Frigid statue standing icy blue and numb
Where are the frost giants I've begged for protection ?
I'm freezing

Cold winter winds that chill my heart with sleet & snow
Not from the North come to this glacial abode
But from your dimension cryogenic limbo
I'm freezing
I'm frozen
It's too late


13. Blood & Fire

I always thought we'd be together
And that our love could not be better
Well with no warning you were gone
I still don't know what went wrong
You don't know what I've been through
Just want to put my love in you

No more nights
of blood & fire

All those special memories
Now I bleed for you - burn for me
Perhaps I was just dreaming
When I think these things had real meaning
You don't know what I've been through
Just want to put my love in you

Love eternal
Lust infernal
Bleeding, burning
Needing, yearning

I see your face in every flame
With no answers I have only myself to blame
Of all the women I have know - they're not you
I'd rather be alone

No more nights
of blood & fire


14. Can't Lose You

I can't lose you
I can't lose you
No I can't lose you
I can't lose you
