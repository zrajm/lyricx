1. Blank Sheets

When we're discovering lies
Our pride will be in vain
Now, recirculate your thoughts
Make them new again
Well, do you know where to start
And do you see the end
You're swallowing books
This is just like the last
And you're wasting your time
In searching for your past
Well, do you know where to start
And do you see the end

And when we return
We all are ashamed
Because the promises of life
We'll never forget
And all that you say
Disclose what we are
We know our sheets will always
Maintain blank

When you hide in your dreams
Do you look behind
Play around with the truth
Constructed in your mind
Well, do you know where to start?
And do you see the end?

And when we return
We all are ashamed
Because the promises of life
We'll never forget
And all that you say
Shows what we are
We know our sheets will always
Maintain blank


2. Dreaming Girl

I am such a peculiar girl
Have my dreams and thoughts in another world
But I live my life
So lost in time, so lost in space
To belong to an unknown human race
But I live my life

Perhaps I will come back again
But I, I don't bother how or when

See, all my dreams don't belong to you
They have nothing with your world to do
They just live my life
So who are you, oh so wise
Who can tell what is wrong or right
You just live your life

And I'll just stay right where I am
My dreams belong to dreaming land

I'm not coming back again, my dreams
Belonging to dreaming land, that's why
I'll stay right where I am, see I
I don't need a helping hand

I am such a peculiar girl
Keep my secret thoughts in a secret world
That's how I live my life
So don't tell me how one's supposed to live
'Cause your eyes don't shine, they've done their time
You have lived your life

That's why, I'll stay right where I am
'Cause I, I don't want to die my friend

No I, I don't want those withered eyes
'Cause I, I want to live my life
No I, I don't want those withered eyes
See I, I want to live, to live my life


3. Without You

You showed me heaven and hell
You said you loved me
Then you said you could do well
Without me

Oh, I've got that, I've got that pain
Oh, I've got that, I've got that pain
Something inside me
A kind of pain
Kind of pain

In some time maybe I'll wonder how it was
I can't imagine I'll never wonder how it was
I just remember too well

You showed me heaven and hell
You said you loved me
Then you said you could do well
You, You showed me heaven and hell
You, You said you loved me
Then you said you could do well
Without me


4. Capio

Capio
Sera' la candidez
Sera' la nina
La historia pasa

Well, I'll love my life
Until the very hour
When I'll be broken
Into the cold

Sera' la candidez
La historia pasa
And another fall
Y en el jardin, yeah
It will be told

Someone who'll end it all
Someone who'll fall
Someone who'll end it all
Somebody's fault

Y en jardin, yeah

7. White-Out Conditions

In the light of my fire
I see footsteps in snow
In white-out conditions
My eyes have no view
In the light of my fire
I see grey sticks in snow
In white-out conditions
There's no trace of the track
There's no trace of the track at all

A peak is blazed with the light from the moon
And there is no view in darkness
I search for the moonlight

A peak is blazed with the light from the moon
And there is no view in darkness
I search for the moonlight

In the light of my fire
I see cornice on stones
In white-out conditions
There's no further view
In the light of my fire
I see grey flakes of snow
In white-out conditions
There is no sign of life
No, there is no sign of life here at all

A peak is blazed with the light from the moon
And there is no view in darkness
I search for the moonlight

A peak is blazed with the light from the moon
And there is no view in darkness
I search for the moonlight

No, there's no view in darkness
I search for the moonlight


8. Baltic Ice-Breaker

Winter: A season of death
You hear a distant sound
Screaming, whining
Along with the cracking of the ice
You can hear someone shouting out your name

The scratching, the screaming, the whining
You're frozen to death
Or is it just the sounds of ice
Under your keel

And you know, you know that you're trapped
Know you're trapped
Corpses are floating up in your wake
Floating up
A voice disappears with the wind
Blows away
Blows away along with the cracking of the ice
The track will be frozen over in a while

The scratching, the screaming, the whining
You're frozen to death
And soon there will be
Only the ice and the snow
Only the ice and the snow


9. Upland

Lyse netter
Tindrende og klar
Vide landskap
Åpne landskap

[[  Bright nights
    Twinkling and clear
    Vast landscapes
    Open landscapes ]]

Elv og daler
Fjord og fossefall
Åpne sletter
Sol der står i brann

[[  Rivers and valleys
    Fjord and waterfall
    Open tracts
    Where the sun is afire ]]
