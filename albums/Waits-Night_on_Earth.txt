1. Back in the Good Old World (gypsy)

When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world.
On October's last I'll fly back home rolling down winding way.
Scare crows are all dressed in rags out at the edge of the field I lay
and all I've got's a pocket full of flowers on my grave.
Oh but summer is gone I remember it best
Back in the good old world.

7. Good Old World (Waltz)

When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world.
On October's last, I'll fly back home rolling down winding way
And all I've got's a pocket full of flowers from my grave
But now summer is gone I remember it best
Back in the good old world I remember when, she held my hand
and we walked home alone in the rain how pretty her mouth, how soft her hair
nothing can be the same and there's a rose upon her breast
where I long to lay my head and her hair was so yellow
and the wine was so red Back in the good old world.


8. Carnival (Brunello Del Montalcino)

9. On the Other Side of the World

There's a blue eyed girl with a red bow tie
and a string of pearls with one good eye
in a rainy town the chimney smoke will curl
no one likes clowns on the other side of the world

and the children know she'll never let me go.

there's a one legged priest that tangos with the farmers wife
Beauty and the beast is taking her own life
and a tear on a letter back home turns into a lake of your own
and a crow turns into a girl on the other side of the world

and she tastes like the sea and she's waiting for me

in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.

And I drink champagne from your thin blue veins

She visits his grave wearing her mother's shawl
should I shave or end it all.
There's an old sailor song that the children know
as their fingers curl around the other side of the world

on a bone white mare lost in Kathleen's hair

in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.
