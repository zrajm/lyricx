1. Doctor Worm

My name is Dr. Worm.
Good morning. How are you? I'm Dr. Worm.
I'm interested in things.
I'm not a real doctor,
But I am a real worm;
I am an actual worm.
I live like a worm.

I like to play the drums.
I think I'm getting good,
But I can handle criticism.
I'll show you what I know,
And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums.
I'll leave the front un-locked 'cause I can't
Hear the doorbell

When I get into it I can't tell if you are
Watching me twirling the stick.
When I give the signal, my friend
Rabbi Vole will pay the solo

Some day somebody else besides me will
Call me by my stage name, they will
Call me Dr Worm.
Good Morning how are you, I'm Dr Worm
I'm interested in things.
I'm not a real doctor,
But I am a real worm;
I am an actual worm.
I live like a worm.

I like to play the drums.
I think I'm getting good,
But I can handle criticism.
I'll show you what I know,
And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums.
I'm not a real doctor,
But they call me Dr. Worm.


2. Severe Tire Damage Theme

[no lyrics]


3. They Got Lost

Julie at the station says They'll be here any minute now
But she's running out of records and her show is ending anyhow.
They can hear her saying Their name on the car radio
But the signal keeps fading out no matter which way They go.
I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around

John said to John, I think we make a left at the light
There should be a big crinkle, assuming this map is right
John looked over and said, Hey, no its not
It's a crumpled up wrapper from the fast food that we got
I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around

Dan said to Hal, "I see somebody walking this way"
So They rolled down the window and said, "Hello. Hey excuse me, hey"
"Could you tell us where we are and the best way out of here"
They could tell from his expression he had absolutely no idea
I heard They Might Be somewhere near this town
They Might Be Giants got lost driving around
Driving around
Driving around
They're still driving around


4. Why Does the Sun Shine?

The sun is a mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees

The sun is hot, the sun is not
A place where we could live
But here on Earth there'd be no life
Without the light it gives

We need its light
We need its heat
The sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's
Atomic energy

The sun is a mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees

The sun is hot

The sun is so hot that everything on it is a gas:
Aluminum, copper, iron, and many others.

The sun is large

If the sun were hollow, a million Earths could fit inside.
And yet, it is only a middle-sized star.

The sun is far away

About 93 million miles away, that's why it looks so small.

But even when it's out of sight
The sun shines night and day

We need its heat
We need its light
The sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's
Atomic energy

Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine.
The heat and light of the sun are caused by nuclear reactions
  between hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and helium.

The sun is a mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees


5. Birdhouse in Your Soul

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary one note* spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels its always near

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

(and while you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the
Birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)

Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul


6. She's an Angel

I met someone at the dog show
She was holding my left arm
But everyone was acting normal so I tried to look nonchalant.
We both said, "I really love you,"
The Shriners loaned us cars
We raced up and down the sidewalk twenty thousand million times

Why did they send her over anyone else?
How should I react? These things happen to other people
They don't happen at all, in fact

When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
I heard they had a space program
When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
Sometimes I think I kind of like that and
Other times I think I'm already there

Gonna ask for my admission
Gonna speak to the man in charge
The secretary says he's on another line,
Can I hold for a long, long time?
I found out she's an angel
I don't think she knows I know
I'm worried that something might happen to me
If anyone ever finds out

Why, why did they send her over anyone else?
How should I react? These things happen to other people
They don't happen at all

When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
I heard they had a space program
When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
Sometimes I think I kind of like that and
Other times I think I'm already there

When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things


7. XTC vs. Adam Ant

XTC versus Adam Ant
Content versus form
Fighting for their place in rock and roll
There is no right or wrong

Just when you think it's finished
With XTC on top
Ant music, like a phoenix
Flies back up the charts

XTC versus Adam Ant
Only one will survive
Beatle-based pop versus new romantic
History will decide

XTC versus Adam Ant
I can't tell you why
Even the singer from Bow Wow Wow
Can't make up her mind

XTC versus Adam Ant
Time is marching on
XTC versus Adam Ant
There is no right or wrong

There is no right or wrong

There is
No right
Or wrong


8. Istanbul (Not Constantinople)

Istanbul was Constantinople
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night

Every gal in Constantinople
Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople
So if you've a date in Constantinople
She'll be waiting in Istanbul

Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
Why they changed it I can't say
People just liked it better that way

So take me back to Constantinople
No, you can't go back to Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks

Istanbul (Istanbul)
Istanbul (Istanbul)

Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
Why they changed it I can't say
People just liked it better that way

So take me back to Constantinople
No, you can't go back to Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks

Istanbul


9. Ana Ng

Make a hole with a gun perpendicular
To the name of this town in a desk-top globe
Exit wound in a foreign nation
Showing the home of the one this was written for
My apartment looks upside down from there
Water spirals the wrong way out the sink
And her voice is a backwards record
It's like a whirlpool and it never ends

Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic
presence
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you

All alone at the '64 World's Fair
Eighty dolls yelling "Small girl after all"
Who was at the Dupont Pavilion?
Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there?
Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
To the horn on the pole at the bus depot
And in the back of the edge of hearing
These are the words the voice was repeating:

Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic
presence
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you

When I was driving once I saw this painted on a bridge:
"I don't want the world, I just want your half"

They don't need me here, and I know you're there (don't need me)
Where the world goes by like the humid air (world goes by)
And it sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks until it goes away (it goes home)
And the truth is, we don't know anything (don't know)

Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic
presence
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you

Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic
presence
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you

Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic
presence
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you


10. First Kiss

The morning
Alarm rings
I'm asleep but she's talking to me
She's walking 'round wearing all of my clothes
But we decided long ago
We'd build a time machine and go

How 'bout another, first kiss kiss kiss yeah
I want another first kiss

Other women were to sentimental
Always worrying about their hair
Got tired of wasting all my time
Now I'm not worrying at all

How 'bout another, first kiss kiss kiss yeah
I want another first kiss kiss kiss yeah
I want another first kiss

The clock [rings],
She's waiting,
I could tell you we belong together
I could tell you you belong with me
But we've run out of things to say
And we'll be happy anyway, so

How 'bout another first kiss kiss kiss yeah
I want another first kiss kiss kiss yeah
I want another first kiss


11. Spider

Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen

Spider
He is our hero
Spider
Get rid of
Spider
Step on spider
Spider
We love you spider

I promise not to kill you
Spider

Spider
We love you spider
Spider
Get rid of
Spider
Must stop
Spider
He is our hero


12. Particle Man

Particle man, particle man
Doing the things a particle can
What's he like? It's not important
Particle man

Is he a dot, or is he a speck?
When he's underwater does he get wet?
Or does the water get him instead?
Nobody knows, Particle man

Triangle man, Triangle man
Triangle man hates particle man
They have a fight, Triangle wins
Triangle man

Universe man, Universe man
Size of the entire universe man
Usually kind to smaller men
Universe man

He's got a watch with a minute hand,
Millenium hand and an eon hand
When they meet it's a happy land
Excellent man, universe man

Person man, person man
Hit on the head with a frying pan
Lives his life in a garbage can
Person man

Is he depressed or is he a mess?
Does he feel totally worthless?
Who came up with person man?
Degraded man, person man

Triangle man, triangle man
Triangle man hates person man
They have a fight, triangle wins
Triangle man


13. She's Actual Size

Words fail
Buildings tumble
The ground opens wide
Light beams down from heaven
She stands before my eyes

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual
size
Nationwide, believe

Big men
Often tremble
As they step aside
I thought I was big once
She changed my mind

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me.
I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
As she drives away

She's got
All the money
Money couldn't buy
She's got something special
That someone left behind

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual
size
As she drives away

Her face
Hangs in portrait
On the post office wall
She's stuck in my heart now
Where my blood belongs

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
Nationwide, believe

Notes
Here's the best guess so far about the lyrics to "Larger than Life."
  Please give input. I need help with all of the reggae lyrics!

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me

Words fail
Buildings tumble
The ground opens wide
Light beams down from heaven
She stands before my eyes

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual
size
As she drives away

Big men
Often tremble
As they step aside
I thought I was big once
She changed my mind

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
Nationwide, believe

You think she's big, you think she's larger than life
But if you open up your eyes you'll see she's actual size
You think she's big, you think she's larger than life
But if you open up your eyes you'll see she's actual
In your mind you have her on a pedestal
You admire her from afar like she's a china doll
You need to realize
Before you ????
So go ahead, approach the girl, it up to you ????

You think she's big, you think she's larger than life
But if you open up your eyes you'll see she's actual size
You think she's big, you think she's larger than life
But if you open up your eyes you'll see she's actual

She's got
All the money
Money couldn't buy
She's got something special
That someone left behind

She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
Actual size, believe

Words fail
Buildings tumble
Light beams down from heaven
She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me


14. S-E-X-X-Y

Dressed only in clothes
From her head to her toes
This is the way
The talking part goes

S-E-X-X-Y
More than enough
Around the clock with nobody else
S-E-X-X-Y

There she is
Standing on the bed
Cookie in one hand, wig on her head
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra baby
Y because it's extra baby
Unnoticed by few
Very very few
And that includes you

Look inside your mind
Look inside your eye
Secret agent spy, come to see why
S-E-X-X-Y

One finger nail
Across your back
Baby's first gold tooth initials inscribed
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra baby
Y because it's extra baby
You gotta understand
She wants to be your man
She's got another plan


15. Meet James Ensor

Meet James Ensor
Belgium's famous painter
Dig him up and shake his hand
Appreciate the man

Before there were junk stores
Before there was junk
He lived with his mother and the torments of Christ
The world was transformed
A crowd gathered round
Pressed against his window so they could be the first

To meet James Ensor
Belgium's famous painter
Raise a glass and sit and stare
Understand the man

He lost all his friends
He didn't need his friends
He lived with his mother and repeated himself
The world has forgotten
The world moved along
The crowd at his window went back to their homes

Meet James Ensor
Meet James Ensor
Belgium's famous painter
Dig him up and shake his hand
Appreciate the man


16. Till My Head Falls Off

There were 87 Advil in the bottle now there's 30 left
I ate 47 so what happened to the other 10?
Why do you suspiciously change the subject and break my concentration
As I dump the bottle out and I count the Advil up again?

Don't interrupt me as I struggle to complete this thought
Have some respect for someone more forgetful than yourself

And I'm not done
And I won't be till my head falls off

Hitting every pocket on my shirt, pants and overcoat
And I'm hitting them again but I don't know where I put my notes
Clearing my throat, and gripping the lectern I smile and face my
audience
Clearing his throat and smiling with his hands on the bathroom sink

And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall
I see stuff through the glass that I don't recognize at all

And I'm not done
And I won't be till my head falls off
Though it may not be a long way off

I'm not done talking yet
I'm not done talking yet

And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall
I see a broken figure silhouetted on the wall

And I'm not done
And I won't be till my head falls off
Though it may not be a long way off
I won't be done until my head falls off


17. About Me

[lyrics missing]


18. Planet Of The Apes (Hidden)

In a world of simians I'm waiting for my thumbs
On the Planet of the Apes this song is sung
We're waiting for our thumbs
We're waiting for our thumbs
In the world of simians we're waiting for our thumbs
One Two Three Four
We're waiting for our thumbs


19. Return From The Planet Of The Apes (hidden)

Cornellius Cornellius, I miss you ape
I miss you ape
I miss your toffee cape
I miss your toffee cape, Cornellius, Cornellius, you were my favorite
ape
I've got to get back to that crazy planet that they call the planet of
the apes
and find Cornellius, my favorite ape
I miss his toffee cape, I say toffee - some would just say tan
but I'm a sophisticated guy so I call it toffee


20. Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes (Hidden)

Conquest, it's a type of quest
They called it a conquest of the Planet of the Apes
Conquest, they played it at request
It was another type of quest
For the Planet of the Apes
Conquest!
Request!
We're gonna have an inquest
but this is a type of quest
For the planet of the Apes
Yeah!


21. Escape From The Planet Of The Apes (Hidden)

Escape from the Planet of the Apes
Well we gotta escape from the Planet of the Apes
'Cause all our friends are on different planet
Yes all my friends are on a different planet now
Gotta escape from the Planet of the Apes
Gotta escape from the Planet of the Apes
I've got a starship that will take you to the planet where Mick Jagger
lives
We've gotta escape to the planet of the Apes
We've gotta escape to the planet of the Apes before we explode.


22. Battle For The Planet Of The Apes (Hidden)

(Crowd chants "people people people", and "ape ape ape" at the
commands of the Johns.)


23. Beneath The Planet Of The Apes (Hidden)

All my friends are beneath the Planet of the Apes
All my friends are
All my friends are
All my friends are beneath the Planet of the Apes
And when I get there
I'll find my friends there
Deep inside the ground
Underneath the town
Where the apes live
Where the apes live
You can't walk around
Because it is in town
All my friends are
All my friends are
Beneath the Planet
Of the Apes


24. This Ape's For You (Hidden)

This Ape's for you
He's coming atcha
This ape's for you
He wants to love you
