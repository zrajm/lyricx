Animal (Cage / Gate / Guide / Zoo)

It's always the same
I'm the only one who's always left to blame
Take what you can take
Hurt is your only idea of a game
To break away
I don't have that within me
And I'm not your prey
So I bite the hand that feeds me

When all you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage

When I look in the mirror
All that I see
A zoo animal that wants to be free
Just get away, get away from me
'Cause I'll never be who you want me to be
No

It's always the same
It's not easy to keep myself contained
Sit back and relax
How can I when I'm going down in flames?

'Cause all you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage

(Chorus)

Get away get away get away get away

(Chorus)

All you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage

When I look in the mirror
I just want to be free
Want to be free
I just want to be free

Modern Angel

I never said those things you buried
Of all the liars you'll be so cynical
The modern angel's so hard to come by
I hate to touch your stinking cur

There are things that one should never see
There are things that one should never see

I don't know what you've started saying now
Give me no conscience, can't listen to bodies
Stay low, lock the door
I know there's more than just an aching in store

I want a gun that's sexual
You wanted size
I'll give you a big tour
Big crane grabs your brain
Pain is a gas engages your force

There are things that one should never see
There are things that one should never see

Your modern angels gone to ruin
Ignorance thinking about stealing the world
As the century fades from view
She give a fuck if you reach twenty-two.

Serial Killers Don't Kill ...

Here, under your bed I wait for you
'Cause I know, I know you want me to
Skeleton in your closet was never so true
You're so very pretty when you're turning blue

When I hear the sound of your voice
You leave me no choice

Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself

I'm feeling lucky tonight
I know your mother thinks I'm society's parasite
Well you can leave your mother home
You know how much I like to be alone

And when I hear the sound of her voice
She leaves me no choice

Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself

Here, under your dress I wait for you
'Cause I know, I know you want me to

When I hear the sound of her voice
She leaves me no choice

Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself
Be myself, wanna be myself

Why can't you go, let me be myself

Skin (Fur Coat)

Stretch-sweat-pierce-lash
Chocke-crush-strange desire to fly
Scream-fight not to scream...

Let's keep on working, man!...

Shadows in the heat
Weaving on the ground
Sparkle in the sun
Boil in the dark
Start to vaporize
Here comes that need to fly... to fly!

Keep on working, man!... keep on working, man!...

Muscles in the dust
Figures in the light
Chocking in the haze
Lashing at the heart

Hurt (desire to)
Fire (desire to)
Shout (desire to)
Burst (desire to)
Fly!

Keep on working, man!

Hate time-hard time-crush time-strong time
Scream-fight no to scream...

Let's keep on working, man!... (5x)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crushed (+Obscene)

Turning me
My conscience is calling me
It wants to shake the beast
The snake is twisting,
My thoughts into needling extremities

Reaction breaks me into fractions
Taking all my energies
Seizing my extremities
So much that I cannot feel now

This heavy heart
Heart that I carry
Still holds the weight of you
And when I fall
As I always do
I'm crushed by the absence of you

Perfection is there
And the expression a stare
A face that leaves no trace of wear and tear
True beauty is cold

Love and hate and human sexual nature
This power is sustained by endless violence and pain
A cycle I can't understand

I'm tired of emotions
They bare me with distortions
They cut me
Screaming "Fuck me"
Wipe them all away now
Let them see through eyes made of stone

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Melt (Again)

Here: every eye is a mirror
Here: every act is a crime
Here: every presence a poison
Here: every wall is a spy

When you say 'turn', they all to turn
When you say 'dive', they're all on their knees

Chorus
Pretending to guide me, you led me astray
I don't want to fall into your kind of ways
I will never sway
And see thing that way

Here: every move is an error
Here: every breath is a fact
Turn! Start! Turn! Dive!
Here: every ear is a danger
Here: every smile is a trap
Here...

Pretending to guide me, you led me astray
I don't want to fall into your kind of ways

Break
I know you'll never take me
Don't even think you'll break me
Be sure you'll never take me
I'm gonna make you see!
Here: every look is a murder
Here: every word is a bite
When you say 'turn', they all start to turn
When you say 'dive', they're all on their knees
Turn! Start! Turn! Dive!
