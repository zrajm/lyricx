Falling Down(Tom Waits)




I have come 500 miles just to see a halo
Come from St. Petersburg, Scarlett and me
Well I open my eyes, I was blind as can be
When you give a man luck, he must fall in the sea
And she wants you to steal and get caught
For she loves you for all that you are not
When you're falling down, falling down
When you're falling down, falling down, falling down

You forget all the roses, don't come around on Sunday
She's not gonna choose you for standing so tall
Go on and take a swig of that poison and like it
And don't ask for silverware, don't ask for nothing
Go on and put your ear to the ground
You know you will be hearing that sound......falling down.
You're falling down, falling down
Falling down, Falling down, falling down

When you're falling down, falling down, falling down


Go on down and see that wrecking ball come swinging on along
Everyone knew that hotel was a goner
They broke all the windows, they took all the door knobs
And they hauled it away in a couple of days
Now someone yell timber and take off your hat
It's a lot smaller down here on the ground
You're falling down, falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down, falling down

Someone's falling down, falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down, falling down

Strange Weather(Tom Waits for Marianne Faithful)




Will you take me across the Channel,
London Bridge is falling down.
Strange a woman tries to save
What a man will try to drown.
And he's the rain that they predicted,
Its the forecast every time.
The rose has died because you picked it
And I believe that brandy's mine.

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather.
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same.

The world is getting flatter,
The sky is falling all around.
And nothing is the matter
For I never cry in town.
And a love like ours, my dear,
Is best measured when its down.
And I never buy umbrellas,
For there's always one around.

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather.
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same.

And you know that its beginning,
And you know that its the end
When once again we are strangers
And the fog comes rolling in.

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather.
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same.
