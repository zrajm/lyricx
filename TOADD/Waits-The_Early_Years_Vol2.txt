Hope I Don't Fall In Love With You


Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,
Well the music plays and you display
your heart for me to see,
I had a beer and now I hear
you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

Well the room is crowded, there's people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown,
take that frown and break it,
Before the evening's gone away,
I think that we could make it, 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

I can see that you are lonesome just like me,
and it being late, you'd like some some company,
Well I've had two, I look at you,
and you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split,
the chair next to you's free, 
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.
Turn around to look at you,
you're nowhere to be found,
I search the place for your lost face,
guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you.

Ol' 55


My time went so quickly, 
I went lickety-splickly
out to my old '55
Pulled away slowly, feeling so holy,
God knows, I was feeling alive.

And now the sun's coming up,
I'm riding with Lady Luck, 
freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade, 
and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, that the feeling's getting stronger.

Now six in the morning, gave me no warning;
I had to be on my way.
Lights passing and trucks a flashing, 
I'm on my way home from your place.

And now the sun's coming up,
I'm riding with Lady Luck, 
freeway cars and trucks.

Mockin' Bird


Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looks like you got the best of me
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me 
now that you're gone

Mocking Bird high in a loof
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me 
now that you're gone.

Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me
Mocking Bird high in a loof
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof.

Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me 
now that you're gone.

Throwed some papers, tried to scare him away
Just looked down at me and this is what he said

Mocking Bird high in a tree
Looks like you got the best of me
Mocking Bird singing his song
Well Mocking Bird mocking me 
now that you're gone

In Between Love


In between love and trying to scheme love
Who can tell what we may find
Never thought love, not get caught love
Between the magic in your eyes
And loves like women, it's cool and breezy
Never thought that love could be so easy

In between love and trying to scheme love
And in between love again

In between love and trying to scheme love
Who can tell what we may find
All this time love, I sublime love
To the feelings in my mind
Loves like women, it's cool and breezy
Never thought that love could be so easy

In between love and trying to scheme love
And in between love again

Blue Skies


Blue skies over my head
Give me another reason to get out of bed
And blue skies shine on my face
Give me another woman to take her place

Ain't got no money, cupboards are bare
No cigarettes and the kids got nothing to wear
She walked out without a word
Now the only sound left is the morning bird
singing ...

Blue skies over my head
Give me another reason to get out of bed
And blue skies shine on my face
Give me another woman to take her place

Blue skies over my head
Give me another reason to get out of bed
And blue skies shine on my face
Give me another woman to take her place
Give me another woman to take her place

Nobody


Nobody, nobody, will ever  love you
the way that I love you
Cause nobody's that strong
Love's bittersweet, life's treasures deep
No one can keep a love that's gone wrong

Nobody, nobody, gonna love you 
the way I could
Cause nobody's that strong
No nobody's that strong

Nobody, nobody, is gonna love you 
the way that I love you
Cause nobody is that strong

You've had many lovers, 
you'll have many others
But they'll only just break 
your poor heart in two
And nobody, nobody, will love you 
the way I could
Cause nobody's that strong, 
no nobody's that strong


tracks


I Want You


I want you, you, you
All I want is you, you, you
All I want is you

Give you the stars above, Sun on the brightest day
Give you all my love, if you would only say
I want you, you, you
All I want is you, you, you
All I want is you

Shiver Me Timbers


I'm leavin' my fam'ly
And leavin' my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
On a new front page sky
My tears are salt water
And the moon's full and high

And I know Martin Eden's
Gonna be proud of me
And many before me
Who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest
And singin' my say
Shiver me Timbers
'Cause I'm a-sailin' away

The fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
and I'm driftin' on out
And Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me.
So come on and swallow me, don't follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone

So please call my missus
Tell her not to cry
'Cause my goodbye is written
By the moon in the sky
And nobody knows me
I can't fathom my stayin'
Shiver me timbers
I'm a-sailin' away

And the fog's liftin'
And the sand's shiftin'
I'm driftin' on out
Ol' Captain Ahab
He ain't got nothin' on me
So come on and swallow me, don't follow me
I'm trav'lin' alone
Blue water's my daughter
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone

And I'm leavin' my family
Leavin' my friends
My body's at home
But my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines
On a new front page sky
And shiver me timbers
I'm a-sailin' away


tracks


Grapefruit Moon


Grapefruit moon, one star shining,
shining down on me.
I heard that tune, and now I'm pining,
honey, can't you see?
That every time I hear that melody,
something breaks inside,
And grapefruit moon, one star shining,
can't turn back the tide.

Never had no destination, could not get across.
You became my inspiration, oh but what a cost.
'Cause every time I hear that melody,
puts me up a tree,
And grapefruit moon, one star shining,
is all that I can see.

Now I'm smoking cigarettes
and I strive for purity,
And I slip just like the stars
into obscurity.
'Cause every time I hear that melody,
well, something breaks inside,
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining,
is much too big to hide.

Diamonds On My Windshield


Diamonds on my windshield
Tears from heaven
Pulling into town on the Interstate
Pulling a steel train in the rain
The wind bites my cheek through the wing
Fast flying, freway driving
Always makes me sing

There's a Duster tryin' to change my tune
Pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly, twenty-four hour moon

Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head
Wishing he was home in a Wiscosin bed
fifteen feet of snow in the East
Colder then a welldigger's ass

Oceanside it ends the ride, San Clemente coming up
Sunday desperadoes slip by, gas station closed, 
cruise with a dry back
Orange drive-in the neon billin'
Theatre's fillin' to the brim
Slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin

Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Fly-by-nights from Riverside
Black and white plates, out of state, 
running a little bit late

Sailors jockey for the fast lane
101 don't miss it
Rolling hills and concrete fields
The broken line's on your mind

Eights go east and the fives go north
The merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line, 
signalling with a blink

The radio's gone off the air
Gives you time to think
You ease it out and you creep across
Intersection light goes out
You hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
Blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
One more block; the engine talks
And whispers 'home at last'
It whispers, whispers, whispers 
'home at last', home at last


tracks


Please Call Me, Baby


The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
But I just know there's got to be more

So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel and I'm blind
If I exorcise my devils
Well my angels may leave too
When they leave they're so hard to find

(Chorus)

We're always at each other's throats
It drives me up the wall
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me
And I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams

(Chorus)

So It Goes


If I was a seagull high and aloof
I'd sail to the highest perch on your roof
But I ain't no seagull, you know my name
And the wind's blowin fortune, the wind's blowin pain
And so it goes, nobody knows
How to get to the sky, how to get to the sky

If I was a puppy dog in the early dawn
I'd make it to your house and sleep on your lawn
but I ain'ty no puppydog, you know my name
And the wind blows fortune, the wind blows pain
And so it goes, nobody knows
How to get to the sky, how to get to the sky
How to get to the sky, how to get to the sky

Old Shoes


Well I'm singing this song, cause it's time it was sung
I've been putting it off for a while,
Cause it's harder by now, and the truth is so clear
That I am crying when I'm seeing you smile.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

And every time that I tried to tell you 
that we'd lost the magic we had at the start,
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I searched once again for the spark.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

Oh you know that there's something calling me dear
and by morning, I'm sure to be gone
For I'm older than you and you know so well
That our time for to love was a song
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

Now I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you crying in the rain,
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.
And goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
