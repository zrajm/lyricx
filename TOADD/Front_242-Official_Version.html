  W.Y.H.I.W.Y.G.
  --------------

  Oh, please
  Get away from me
  Are you crazy?
  Nobody can hear you

  THEY'RE COMING DOWN
  THEY'RE COMING DOWN
  THEY'RE COMING DOWN FOR YOU

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Rerun Time
  ----------

  Take our time
  Hold the line
  Is it important
  Such a mess
  Tenderness
  This is my secret

  I'm so glad
  You go mad
  We're on the cover
  You won't dare
  Just entertainment

  You say yes
  You say no
  Remain indifferent
  I'm so scared
  Unprepared
  It makes no difference

  I'm so glad
  You go mad
  Is it important?
  That's enough
  Leave the time
  And watch the future

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Television Station
  ------------------

  Hey man
  You'd better move aside
  Or I'll run you over
  I warn you
  I'm on my way to the top
  And I'll reach it alone
  I know I can't fail
  No threat
  No Hindrance on my road
  Will deter me
  I'm on my way to the top

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Agressiva Due
  -------------

  IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE
  YES, WE DID HIT HIM AGAIN
  WE TRIED QUITE DIPLOMACY AND
  DEMONSTRATIONS OF MILITARY FORCE

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  MasterHit - Part I & II
  -----------------------

  YOU KNOW ME AND I SURE KNOW YOU
  EVERYONE

  You seem so... Tender

  Give me some more of the warm little beasts
  I'm so fond of

  Master, I'm so glad to feel your presence
  But you don't seem to share my impatience
  I relied upon you to break the silence
  I cannot understand your reluctance

  Master, I feel so warm and I'm so happy, oh master

  Give me some more of the warm little beasts
  I'm so fond of

  You seem so
  I could melt the frozen wall you raised between us
  and now I'm on the other side, you seem rather surprised

  Constricting viscous rings around your warm body
  Holding you tied, holding you tied... and I feel so happy

  You seem so tender
  As the warm little beasts
  I'm so fond of

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Slaughter
  ---------

  The slightest contusion becomes a lethal wound
  You know how to lie, you know how to take a hint

  Resorting to proper measures to stop the trend
  Previously unyielding but now compelled to bend
  but now compelled to

  OFFICIAL VERSION
  OFFICIAL VERSION

  The calling of forces from which I can't recoil
  Previously unyielding but now compelled to bend

  It's a carnage

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Quite Unusual
  -------------

  The sun went down and the ground started sort
  of grinding
  A blinding light tore across the sky
  A cyclone swept the landscape out and left it
  completely flattened out
  And several twirls of smoke unfolded like gigantic
  flowers

  The way the morning broke was quite unusual

  I should have wakened up at once, but this was no
  concern of mine, so I kept on dreaming

  My eyes roamed over the burning ruins

  In less time than it takes to tell

  And I felt like
  And I felt like being numbed,
  I felt like mesmerized

  The way the morning broke was quite unusual
  More than words can say

  In less time than it takes to tell

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Red Team
  --------

  I am the next stage
  I am the next stage
  Are you able to follow the Red Team?
  Are you able to follow the Red Team?

  Death can take a thousand faces
  They all look familiar to me
  I live in a world of paradox
  My willingness to destroy
  Is your chance for improvement
  My hate is your faith
  My failure is your victory
  A victory that won't last
  A victory that won't last

  O.K.
  Electronic jamming?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Agressiva
  ---------

  It's up to you to decide
  Are you prepared to slave again?

  Let's get down to work
  It's up to you to decide

  With all their courage they face
  The enemies and guns who took the place
  Where the freedom never appears

  It worked so well before
  Let's use it once more

  It's up to you to decide
  To preserve the power on your side

  In their eyes rush and charge
  Let's get down to work
  Let's get down to combat
