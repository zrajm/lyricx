Is There Any Way Out Of This Dream


I can see clearly nothing as clear
I keep falling apart ev'ry year
Let's take a hammer to it
There's no glamour in it
Is there any way out of this dream

I'm as blue as I can possibly be
Is there someone else out there for me
Summer is dragging it's feet
I feel so incomplete
Is there any way out of this dream

Picking Up After You


Here comes the bride
And there goes the groom
Looks like a hurricane
Went thru this room
Smells like a poolhall
Where's my other shoe
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you

Looks like you spent the nite in a trench
And tell me,
How long have you been combing your hair with a wrench
Blue roses are dead
And the violets are too
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you

Well, I've told you before
I won't tell you again
You don't defrost the icebox
With a ball point pen
This railroad apartment
Is held together with glue
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you

Because I know
I been swindled
I never bargained for this
Once more you never cared about me
Why don't you get your own place
So you can live like you do
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you

Take all your relatives
And all of your shoes
Believe me I'll really swing
When you're gone
I'll be living on chicken and wine
After we're thru
With someone I pick up after you
With someone I'll pick up after you
With someone I'll pick up after you
with someone I'll pick up after you

Old Boyfriends


Old Boyfriends,
Lost in the pocket of your overcoat,
Like burned out lite bulbs on a Ferris Wheel.

Old Boy friends,
You remember the kinds of cars they drove,
Parking in an orange grove.
He fell in love you see,
With someone that I used to be.

Tho I very seldom think of him,
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's 
Blue satin dress can make the window
Like a dream
Ah but now those dreams belong to someone else,
Now they talk endlessly
In a drawer where I keep
All my 

Old Boyfriends
Remember when you were burning for them?
Why do you keep turning them into
Old Boyfriends?
They look you up when they're in town
To see if they can still burn you down
You fell in love you see
With someone that I used to be

Old Boyfriends
Turn up every time it rains,
Fall out of the pages in a magazine
Old Boyfriends.
Girls fill up the bars every spring,
Not places for remembering.
Old boyfriends
All my old boyfriends
Old boyfriends

Broken Bicycles


Broken bicycles,
Old busted chains,
With busted handle bars
Out in the rain.
Somebody must
Have an orphanage for
All these things that nobody
Wants any more
September's reminding July
It's time to be saying good-bye.

Summer is gone,
Our love will remain.
Like old broken bicycles
Out in the rain.

Broken Bicycles,
Don't tell my folks;
There's all those playing cards
Pinned to the spokes,
Laid down like skeletons
out on the lawn.
The wheels won't turn
When the other has gone.
The seasons can turn on a dime,
Somehow I forget every time;
For all the things that you've given me
Will always stay
Broken, but I'll never throw them away

I Beg Your Pardon


I'm just a scarecrow
with out you
baby please don't disappear
I beg your pardon dear

I gotta a bottle full of trumpet
a hatbox full of drum
I beg your pardon dear

I got upset
I lost my head
I didn't mean
the things I said
You are the landscape
Of my dreams
Darlin' I beg your pardon

I'd give your Boardwalk
And Park Place
And all of my hotels
I beg your pardon dear

Please don't go back to St. Louis
Can't you tell that I'm sincere
I beg your pardon dear

Little Boy Blue


Little Boy Blue 
come blow your horn
the dish ran away with the spoon
home again home again
saturday morn
never gets up before noon

she used to render
you legal and tender
when you used to 
send her your promises boy
a dill or a dollar
unbutton your collar
come out and holler 
out all of your noise

little boy blue
come blow your top
cut it rite down to the quick
don't sit home and cry
on the fourth of july
around now you're hittin' bricks

so abracadabra
now she disappeared
now everything's Canada dry
so watch your behavior
and rattle your cane
with a bottle of bourbon
Good-bye

little boy blow
lost little bo peep
she fell thru a hole in the nest
Now ain't it peculiar
that she's finally cooled your
big wheels just like all of the rest

whenever it rains
the umbrella complain
they're always gettin' played for a chump
so mark and strike it
she's history now
and you're hangin' out at the pump

Little Boy Blue...

she used to render...

You Can't Unring a Bell


You can't unring a bell, junior
It'll cost ya to get out of this one, junior
Cause he's got big plans
That don't include you
take it like a man

cause you, you can't unring a bell, sucker
you'll need an attorney for this journey, junior

how's it feel
how do you like it in the slam
you're a little man in a great big town
perhaps you were a little hasty
heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
you can't take back the things you said, man

Cause you can't unring a bell, Junior
aaghhhh
hurts don't it
take it like a man
get it thru your head
suffer
heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh

This One's From the Heart


As you go out   it's Independence Day;
But instead I'll just pour myself a drink.
It's got to be love, I've never felt this way.
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

The shadows in the road look like a railroad track.
I wonder if he's (ever) really comin' back.
The moon's a yellow stain across the sky.
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

(Maybe) And I'll go down to the corner and get a racin' form,
(But) And I should prob'ly wait here by the phone.
And the brakes need adjustment on the convertible
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

The worm is climbin' the other color tree
Robin is back against the wall;
Pour myself a double sympathy
Oh baby, this one's from the heart.

Blondes, brunettes, and redheads put their hammer down
(To put ) don't pound a cold chisel thru my heart.
But they were nothin' but apostrophes.
O baby, this one's from the heart.

I can't tell, is that a siren or a saxophone?
But the roads get so slipp'ry (when it rains)
I love you more than all these words can ever say
Oh baby, this one's from the heart.

The Wages of Love



Down thru the ages
All the sages
said don't spend your wages on Love

Graft and collusion
_____ the intrusion
and proceeding foreclosures
there's overexposures

down at the crossroads
the question is posed
bridge is washed out
and the highway's closed

___ ___ ___ reason
firmly believe
love was designed
to exploit and deceive

There's a _____
Wherever you send 'em
Every ball ___ ___ in your chest
You will see
simple addition
keeps with tradition
Don't spend your wages on Love

Taking any burgh any city or town
Just get on main street and
drive all the way down

You see love has a graveyard
___ ___ __ ___
___ ___ ___ ___ ___
and paid thru the nose

your shovel's a shot glass
dig your own hole
bury what's left of your miserable soul

Down thru the ages
All the sages
said don't spend your wages on Love

Graft and collusion
_____ the intrusion
and proceeding foreclosures
there's overexposures

down at the crossroads
the question is posed
bridge is washed out
and the highway's closed
